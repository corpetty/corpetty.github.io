[{"content":"   Introduction After an interview with Toby Simpson, the COO of fetch.ai, on Hashing It Out (will be released shortly), I shared a blog article of his that was mentioned in The Bitcoin Podcast slack for others to read it. It is a post about the consequences of \u0026ldquo;becoming a bank\u0026rdquo; that aren\u0026rsquo;t often talked about, and gives some guidance on how to increase your level of personal security by setting up a hardware wallet. It is a good article, I\u0026rsquo;d suggest you read it.\nOne of the reactions from the slack was about technical concerns of Ledger hardware wallets, quoted below:\n Corey thanks for sharing, interesting read. As a non technical noob I’m fairly confident of my ledger wallet set up if my small bag X10 or more.\nHowever the thing that I\u0026rsquo;m worried about is a retirement attack where ledger employee has pre uploaded 1000’s of seeds where he/she is waiting till there is $1billion and takes it all. From what I have heard only a phase 25th word can prevent this. This was too technical so I haven’t done it. Same with multisig. How worried should I be of this? Anything I can do about it.\nI know I have to level up, at 41 my brain can’t be fked learning new things. You maybe interested in this pod if you haven’t heard already.\n Two things here, the possibility of this attack on a ledger hardware wallet, and then how it pertains to a multisig. I\u0026rsquo;ll tackle the first as well as what you\u0026rsquo;re generally protected by, and then explain the concpet of a multisig and how it provides additional security.\nCan a Ledger hardware wallet be \u0026ldquo;retirement attacked?\u0026rdquo; If you are unaware of what a seed phrase is, I would recommend reading the above mentioned article so that you get a mental idea of what it is, and how pivotal it is in the context of the security of your cryptocurrency. In short, it is the password that derives all of your key material in cryptocurrency, which gives you the ability to \u0026ldquo;own\u0026rdquo; digital assets on a blockchain. Having access to it means having access to all of your cryptocurrency.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s first outline the attack mentioned:\n A ledger employee pre-uploads 1000\u0026rsquo;s of seed phrases onto hardware wallets, assuming during some part of manufacturing process. Said employee monitors the assets that are loaded onto the uploaded seed phrases, and waits until they hit a certain threshhold value of his/her choosing. Once the threshhold is met, said employee swipes all of the assets to a seperate wallet of his/her ownership and absconds with the money.  So in order for the attacker (the Ledger employee) to successfully pull this off, two things need to be true:\n The Ledger manufacturing process needs to pre-load seed phrases, and an employee will need to be able to infuence this process. The attacker will need access to your Ledger device password (if you optionally choose to have one)  Let\u0026rsquo;s take care of that first one real quick. Ledger employees do not pre-upload seed phrases on devices during manufacturing. Instead, they are generated on the device using a TRNG inside the devices Secure Element (a physically seperated, higher security chip on the device).\nThe Ledger manufacturing process has no control over the seed phrases that are generated on the device  Note that this means you should never use a hardware wallet that comes with a seed phrase pre-loaded on it!\nIf you are still uncomfortable and do not trust this, you can always generate a seed phrase yourself and use the recovery process of the ledger to load it manually on the device.\nAdditionally (to the second point), you can optionally add a password to the device, which is required when turning on the Ledger to do anything. When doing this, you fundamentally change the derived addresses associated with the seed phrase, as it is a part of the key derivation process . That means, you can have any number of \u0026ldquo;address sets\u0026rdquo; based on the password you use with a single seed phrase. It follows that if an attacker somehow gets access to your seed phrase, in order for them to get access to your funds, he/she must also know your password.\nHow does a multisig increase my security? I won\u0026rsquo;t spend too much time explaining the details of the multisig, only quickly comment on their interaction with a hardware wallet.\nIn general, a multisig address is defined by a single address \u0026ldquo;owned\u0026rdquo; by multiple addresses (of which can actually also be a multisig). In order to pass a transcation from the main address, N-of-M of the owners are required to approve it. This distributes the risk across multiple other addresses. I will also not go into the diferent implementations and their limitations in this article. So this allows for a couple different scenarios (none exhaustive):\n A single user has a multi-factor authentication on an account, so they are able to distribute risk of the account. An example of this is a single user having to sign a transaction with multiple different accounts on diffrent devices, so that a lose or compromise of a single device doesn\u0026rsquo;t compromise the entire account. Multiple users share an account and in order to sign any transactions, a certain minimum number of the group have to agree and approve the transaction. This distributes risk across owners for a given account any combination of the above  A hardware wallet, in this context, can be where the single address is held and controlled. Meaning either one of your devices for an account is on the Ledger, and maybe another is in your mobile phone wallet. Or for multiple owners scenario, each owner controls their address on a hardware device of their own, combining the security improvements of both the hardware wallet and multisignature wallet. This is actually considered best practices for any substantial value amount.\nConclusion I hope that this article has answered the initial question in enough detail. There are a lot of subleties to how this stuff works, and it can quickly become confusing. If you are unsure about all the things, it is generally accepted good practice to use a Ledger hardware wallet (or other leading manufacturer).\nUnless you are an advanced user, just be sure to only buy from the manufacturer, back-up your seed phrase securely, and use a passphrase.\nI would like to thank the folks in The Bitcoin Podcast slack for continuing to have useful and intersting conversations.

My name is Corey Petty, this is the bio I typically send people when on various media outlets, which are currently, at least tangientially, attached to \u0026ldquo;Blockchain\u0026rdquo; in some way:\n Dr. Corey Petty started his blockchain focused research around 2012 as a personal hobby while doing his PhD candidacy at Texas Tech University in Computational Chemical Physics. He then went on to co-found The Bitcoin Podcast Network and still serves as a host on the flagship The Bitcoin Podcast and a more technical show Hashing It Out. Corey left academia and entered the data science/blockchain security industry for a few years attempting to fix vulnerabilities in ICS/SCADA networks before finding his fit as the head of security at Status.im where he remains today.\n But that picks up after a past life of academia, which molded a good portion of who I am today. After high school at Cedar Hill High School, I worked on a bachelors in Physics, then a PhD in Chemistry at Texas Tech University. The bulk of material output can be found in the Pub section of this site.\nAfter my PhD defense, I continued this research at the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica in São José dos Campos, Brazil. During my time there, I started my contribution to the Blockchain world via the creation of The Bitcoin Podcast.\n","description":"A bit about Corey and this site.","id":2,"section":"","tags":null,"title":"About","uri":"http://coreypetty.com/about/"},{"content":"Podcasts  The Bitcoin Podcast Hashing It Out  Website Building  Hugo  Blockchain Stuff Ethereum  Sweeposaurus - Utility to help with moving multiple funds in an Ethereum wallet to another.

As per usualsome text here, folks were sending interesting news in he Bitcoin Podcast slack. This one happened to catch my eye as it\u0026rsquo;s an update I\u0026rsquo;ve been waiting for; Bitcoin is getting two major improvements in historic code update from Decrypt. I immediately said we would talk about this in the upcoming The Bitcoin Podcast episode roundtable. But first, I\u0026rsquo;d wanted to take some notes and jot down a few things so that I can share what these technologies are, what they potentially mean, and the remaining road ahead for those that don\u0026rsquo;t listen the podcast, but are still interested.\nFor those who would like to listen to our conversation about this on The Bitcoin podcast, here\u0026rsquo;s the episode:\n I\u0026rsquo;m also trying to write more (hence this website / blog / resource / whatever).\nWhat happened? For those that don\u0026rsquo;t know, the Bitcoin ecosystem has been working on some protocol level improvements that drastically expand the capabilities of the system. On October 15th, 2020, a pull request was merged into the Bitcoin Core codebase which adds a bunch of new features which have been under review for quite a long time. Namely, Schnorr signatures , Taproot , and Tapscript .\nWhat do those words mean? Many have already asked me what these different changes are, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to try and conceptually explain them at a high level:\nSchnorr Signatures To start, I did a Hashing It Out Interview with Andrew Poelstra about a year ago that described Schnorr signatures with some detail, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend checking it out. For the lazy, or those that don\u0026rsquo;t like audio content, here\u0026rsquo;s an overview:\nCurrently, the Bitcoin protocol uses digital signatures to sign messages. The algorithm used to do this is ECDSA, specifically for keypairs on the secp256k1 curve . The proposal is to extend signature schemes to include the ability to sign messages via the Schnorr algorithm (on the same curve). At a high level, this allows a message that is signed by multiple keys to be aggregated into a single signature, which results in a more efficient message size. This algorithm also has efficiency gains in verification and authentication processes.\nFor instance, if you\u0026rsquo;d like to send a transaction that requires multiple UTXOs, you would previously have to include every signature of each UXTO included in the message (this is very common occurrence as HD wallets are standard practice). The Schnorr algorithm turns all of those signatures into a single signature.\nTaproot Taproot is an improvement on a different technology called Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree or MAST. In short, a MAST allows you to stack Bitcoin scripts into a Merkle tree, expanding the possible things a Bitcoin txn is capable of doing .\nTapscript Tapscript is a short name for referring to the updates required to the validation process in Bitcoin. Taproot is an update to the Bitcoin script language. More specifically, it aims at including the previously mentioned technologies available so that Bitcoin is capable of validating transactions that use them.\nWhat happens next? So this post is all about the fact that the code has been incorporated into the main client codebase, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t the end of the story. In order for these technologies to actually be used in Bitcoin, the community will have to go through some activation mechanism.\nSome thoughts on the repercussions text TBD\n","description":"A commentary on the news that Schnorr and Taproot have been incorporated into Bitcoin codebase.","id":4,"section":"posts","tags":["taproot","Bitcoin","schnorr","tapscript"],"title":"Schnorr and Taproot make it into Bitcoin codebase.
