[{"content":"   Introduction After an interview with Toby Simpson, the COO of fetch.ai, on Hashing It Out (will be released shortly), I shared a blog article of his that was mentioned in The Bitcoin Podcast slack for others to read it. It is a post about the consequences of \u0026ldquo;becoming a bank\u0026rdquo; that aren\u0026rsquo;t often talked about, and gives some guidance on how to increase your level of personal security by setting up a hardware wallet. It is a good article, I\u0026rsquo;d suggest you read it.\nOne of the reactions from the slack was about technical concerns of Ledger hardware wallets, quoted below:\n Corey thanks for sharing, interesting read. As a non technical noob I’m fairly confident of my ledger wallet set up if my small bag X10 or more.\nHowever the thing that I\u0026rsquo;m worried about is a retirement attack where ledger employee has pre uploaded 1000’s of seeds where he/she is waiting till there is $1billion and takes it all. From what I have heard only a phase 25th word can prevent this. This was too technical so I haven’t done it. Same with multisig. How worried should I be of this? Anything I can do about it.\nI know I have to level up, at 41 my brain can’t be fked learning new things. You maybe interested in this pod if you haven’t heard already.\n Two things here, the possibility of this attack on a ledger hardware wallet, and then how it pertains to a multisig. I\u0026rsquo;ll tackle the first as well as what you\u0026rsquo;re generally protected by, and then explain the concpet of a multisig and how it provides additional security.\nCan a Ledger hardware wallet be \u0026ldquo;retirement attacked?\u0026rdquo; If you are unaware of what a seed phrase is, I would recommend reading the above mentioned article so that you get a mental idea of what it is, and how pivotal it is in the context of the security of your cryptocurrency. In short, it is the password that derives all of your key material in cryptocurrency, which gives you the ability to \u0026ldquo;own\u0026rdquo; digital assets on a blockchain. Having access to it means having access to all of your cryptocurrency.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s first outline the attack mentioned:\n A ledger employee pre-uploads 1000\u0026rsquo;s of seed phrases onto hardware wallets, assuming during some part of manufacturing process. Said employee monitors the assets that are loaded onto the uploaded seed phrases, and waits until they hit a certain threshhold value of his/her choosing. Once the threshhold is met, said employee swipes all of the assets to a seperate wallet of his/her ownership and absconds with the money.  So in order for the attacker (the Ledger employee) to successfully pull this off, two things need to be true:\n The Ledger manufacturing process needs to pre-load seed phrases, and an employee will need to be able to infuence this process. The attacker will need access to your Ledger device password (if you optionally choose to have one)  Let\u0026rsquo;s take care of that first one real quick. Ledger employees do not pre-upload seed phrases on devices during manufacturing. Instead, they are generated on the device using a TRNG inside the devices Secure Element (a physically seperated, higher security chip on the device).\nThe Ledger manufacturing process has no control over the seed phrases that are generated on the device  Note that this means you should never use a hardware wallet that comes with a seed phrase pre-loaded on it!\nIf you are still uncomfortable and do not trust this, you can always generate a seed phrase yourself and use the recovery process of the ledger to load it manually on the device.\nAdditionally (to the second point), you can optionally add a password to the device, which is required when turning on the Ledger to do anything. When doing this, you fundamentally change the derived addresses associated with the seed phrase, as it is a part of the key derivation process. That means, you can have any number of \u0026ldquo;address sets\u0026rdquo; based on the password you use with a single seed phrase. It follows that if an attacker somehow gets access to your seed phrase, in order for them to get access to your funds, he/she must also know your password.\nHow does a multisig increase my security? I won\u0026rsquo;t spend too much time explaining the details of the multisig, only quickly comment on their interaction with a hardware wallet.\nIn general, a multisig address is defined by a single address \u0026ldquo;owned\u0026rdquo; by multiple addresses (of which can actually also be a multisig). In order to pass a transcation from the main address, N-of-M of the owners are required to approve it. This distributes the risk across multiple other addresses. I will also not go into the diferent implementations and their limitations in this article. So this allows for a couple different scenarios (none exhaustive):\n A single user has a multi-factor authentication on an account, so they are able to distribute risk of the account. An example of this is a single user having to sign a transaction with multiple different accounts on diffrent devices, so that a lose or compromise of a single device doesn\u0026rsquo;t compromise the entire account. Multiple users share an account and in order to sign any transactions, a certain minimum number of the group have to agree and approve the transaction. This distributes risk across owners for a given account any combination of the above  A hardware wallet, in this context, can be where the single address is held and controlled. Meaning either one of your devices for an account is on the Ledger, and maybe another is in your mobile phone wallet. Or for multiple owners scenario, each owner controls their address on a hardware device of their own, combining the security improvements of both the hardware wallet and multisignature wallet. This is actually considered best practices for any substantial value amount.\nConclusion I hope that this article has answered the initial question in enough detail. There are a lot of subleties to how this stuff works, and it can quickly become confusing. If you are unsure about all the things, it is generally accepted good practice to use a Ledger hardware wallet (or other leading manufacturer).\nUnless you are an advanced user, just be sure to only buy from the manufacturer, back-up your seed phrase securely, and use a passphrase.\nI would like to thank the folks in The Bitcoin Podcast slack for continuing to have useful and intersting conversations.

I immediately said we would talk about this in the upcoming The Bitcoin Podcast episode roundtable.

As per usualsome text here , folks were sending interesting news in he Bitcoin Podcast slack. This one happened to catch my eye as it\u0026rsquo;s an update I\u0026rsquo;ve been waiting for; Bitcoin is getting two major improvements in historic code update from Decrypt. I immediately said we would talk about this in the upcoming The Bitcoin Podcast episode roundtable. But first, I\u0026rsquo;d wanted to take some notes and jot down a few things so that I can share what these technologies are, what they potentially mean, and the remaining road ahead for those that don\u0026rsquo;t listen the podcast, but are still interested.\nFor those who would like to listen to our conversation about this on The Bitcoin podcast, here\u0026rsquo;s the episode:\n I\u0026rsquo;m also trying to write more (hence this website / blog / resource / whatever).\nWhat happened? For those that don\u0026rsquo;t know, the Bitcoin ecosystem has been working on some protocol level improvements that drastically expand the capabilities of the system. On October 15th, 2020, a pull request was merged into the Bitcoin Core codebase which adds a bunch of new features which have been under review for quite a long time. Namely, Schnorr signatures, Taproot, and Tapscript.\nWhat do those words mean? Many have already asked me what these different changes are, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to try and conceptually explain them at a high level:\nSchnorr Signatures To start, I did a Hashing It Out Interview with Andrew Poelstra about a year ago that described Schnorr signatures with some detail, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend checking it out. For the lazy, or those that don\u0026rsquo;t like audio content, here\u0026rsquo;s an overview:\nCurrently, the Bitcoin protocol uses digital signatures to sign messages. The algorithm used to do this is ECDSA, specifically for keypairs on the secp256k1 curve. The proposal is to extend signature schemes to include the ability to sign messages via the Schnorr algorithm (on the same curve). At a high level, this allows a message that is signed by multiple keys to be aggregated into a single signature, which results in a more efficient message size. This algorithm also has efficiency gains in verification and authentication processes.\nFor instance, if you\u0026rsquo;d like to send a transaction that requires multiple UTXOs, you would previously have to include every signature of each UXTO included in the message (this is very common occurrence as HD wallets are standard practice). The Schnorr algorithm turns all of those signatures into a single signature.\nTaproot Taproot is an improvement on a different technology called Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree or MAST. In short, a MAST allows you to stack Bitcoin scripts into a Merkle tree, expanding the possible things a Bitcoin txn is capable of doing.\nTapscript Tapscript is a short name for referring to the updates required to the validation process in Bitcoin. Taproot is an update to the Bitcoin script language. More specifically, it aims at including the previously mentioned technologies available so that Bitcoin is capable of validating transactions that use them.\nWhat happens next? So this post is all about the fact that the code has been incorporated into the main client codebase, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t the end of the story. In order for these technologies to actually be used in Bitcoin, the community will have to go through some activation mechanism.\nSome thoughts on the repercussions text TBD\n","description":"A commentary on the news that Schnorr and Taproot have been incorporated into Bitcoin codebase.","id":4,"section":"posts","tags":["taproot","Bitcoin","schnorr","tapscript"],"title":"Schnorr and Taproot make it into Bitcoin codebase. So what?","uri":"http://coreypetty.com/posts/2020-10-18_bitcoin-schnorr-taproot/"},{"content":"I recently listened to an episode of Joe Rogan where Nick Bostrom tried to explain the concept of simulation theory. Although the progenitor of the concept tried multiple times, it seemed as though there was some roadblock to understanding, so I’d like to give it a shot. The best method would be to do it through the Socratic method, where questions are asked to allow the other participants to reach the conclusion desired themselves. That’s kinda hard through text, so I’ll just discuss the path I see as required to understand the statement below.\nThis short article is an attempt to explain what the following sentence means:\n If the simulation hypothesis is correct, the reality we are in is most probably a simulation.\n This is a profound statement that follows directly from a set of assumptions. I think Nick Bostrom failed at establishing what those assumptions are. So here we go. I’m going to state the assumptions and the framework it makes, then show how that inevitably leads to the previous statement.\nOk cool, so if we are to look at the simulation argument, then we are to believe there are 3 possible options on the evolution of intelligent existence across the universe:\n All civilizations of intelligence fail to reach sufficient advancement to get past the required technology to create simulations. Some civilizations of intelligence reach sufficient advancement to get to the required technology to create simulations, but for some reason, choose not to pursue creating simulations Some civilizations of intelligence reach sufficient advancements to get to the required technology to create simulations and continue on to create said simulations.  That’s it. We have three options for the possibility of how intelligent civilizations progress. This blog post is NOT about which option is correct, though. We want to talk about probabilities ONLY IF OPTION 3 IS CORRECT. So let’s make an assumption:\n Assumption #1: In the lifetime f the universe, there will exist a civilization of intelligence that reaches the required level of technology to create simulations of the universe.\n We’ve cut out options 1 and 2. That’s a big assumption, but follow along throughout this thought experiment, because it will show how those that say things in this field come to the their conclusions.\nOk cool, based on Assumption #1, we’re going to pretend that at some point in the entire lifetime of the universe, some intelligence reaches the technological complexity to make simulations that rival our current experience of reality. It is so good that it is impossible to know whether what we perceive as existence is a simulation or reality. This leads to another assumption:\n Assumption #2: The simulations created by the intelligence are of sufficient quality that observers inside them would be incapable of understanding that they’re in a simulation. It is indistinguishable from “reality.”\n Note that we have not yet discussed OUR place in this, only that something happens sometime by someone. We’ll get to us later.\nSo let’s take stock of where we’re at now. Based on the stated assumptions, a civilization of intelligence comes into being at some point in the universe and creates a number of simulations that are so good that those inside it are capable of asking themselves if they’re in a simulation. We now have two groups of people that are able to ask the question “am I in a simulation:” those in a simulation, and those that are in the reality that created the simulations.\nSo which group are we in? What can we say from here? We as humans on Earth are a civilization of intelligence that is capable of asking “are we in a simulation?” If we follow the above assumptions, then we can only look at the distribution of possible people able to ask that question. That’s a shit load of people in simulations and a small amount of folks in the reality that created them. Since we can’t know which reality we’re in because the simulations are so good, it immediately follows that:\n If one has to pick randomly against all the potential people able to ask the question “am I in a simulation”, they are most probably going to pick from the group that is in a simulation and not the group that created the simulations.\n Why? Because the group in a simulation is so much larger than the group that isn’t. That’s all they are saying. If you want to believe that a sufficient simulation can exist, then it immediately follows that you are most probably in such a simulation from a sheer numbers and statistics point of view. Let’s restate everything together.\nIf we are to assume that some intelligence across the entire lifetime of the universe reaches enough advancement so they can create simulations that are indistinguishable to our current understanding of existence, then we are (from a statistics point of view) most probably in one of those simulations.\nNote that the above statement doesn’t mean that we aren’t the actual intelligence that goes on to create simulations, just that it is very unlikely. Based on our assumptions, anyone who is capable of asking the question is incapable of knowing if they’re in a simulation because the simulation is that good, so we have no way of knowing if we’re in one.\nHope that helps, it was fun to think about how to explain this, and frustrating to listen to the 1 hour of the episode where that didn’t seem to click.\n","description":"I recently listened to an episode of Joe Rogan where Nick Bostrom tried to explain the concept of simulation theory.

If you don’t understand public-private key cryptography, then those sayings offer no explanation or insight to one of the most important features of this technology: controlling the access to your value. This topic has come up a few times within the Slack community of The Bitcoin Podcast Network, so I decided it was worth explaining some basic concepts required to truly understand what this means and why it’s so important.\ntl;dr: There isn’t one — you should know this if you plan to buy or use cryptocurrencies.\nCryptography 101 (and some basics of how we use them in the blockchain industry) I strongly believe that good decision-making comes from understanding. To that end, I am going to explain some basics of what “private-keys” are, where they come from, and how we can store them. If you’re comfortable with this material already, read this and let me know if I can do a better job of explaining it to others. This is just how stuff works. I will use the way Bitcoin does things, as our example, as it has garnered the most attention and public exposure; the general process can be extended to everything else in the blockchain/cryptocurrency industry.\nPublic-Key Cryptography It all starts here. Public-Key cryptography (also known as Public-Private Key or Asymmetric cryptography) is a foundational building block of blockchain technology. In order to use it, you need a pair of generated keys: one public, one private. The public-key can be passed out to others, while the private-key should be kept secret (the names should have given that part away). In general, this enables two functionalities:\n authentication — You can digitally sign data with your private-key, which can be verified by anyone who has access to the public-key. Bitcoin uses this function. encryption — Obfuscate data with a public-key so that no one knows what it is, which can only be converted back to its original form with the private-key. Bitcoin doesn’t use this function.  These keys can be generated by a lot of different algorithms. Bitcoin uses a specific one that uses elliptic curve mathematics, which is beyond the scope of this blog. Remember that the private-key is just a number, picked at random, between 1 and 2²⁵⁶. The public-key is then generated via some relatively complicated but well understood math. The important thing to know about this process is that it is relatively easy to do, but INCREDIBLY HARD AND NOT CURRENTLY FEASIBLE to do the opposite —i.e. you cannot create a private-key from a given public-key.\nAddresses Ok cool, you have a public-private key-pair. The next step (which is all done by wallet software for you now-a-days) is to generate an address associated with this key-pair. This is done by a specific algorithm that ensures that for every key-pair, there is a matching address. It is also important to note that you can go from the public-key to the address, but not the other way around. Just like you can go from a private-key to a public-key, but not the other way.\nHow it fits together Your address is your identity on the Bitcoin blockchain, your private-key is how you prove your ownership of it, and your public-key is how others validate that proof.\nYou move Bitcoin around by creating transactions and submitting them to the network to be validated by miners. A transaction is basically a message telling the network that you want to send Bitcoin that you have associated with your address to a different address. How can people verify that you sent the transaction, you ask? The beauty of public-key cryptography allows you to authenticate the transaction by digitally signing it with your private-key.\nSo if I receive a signed transaction, I can use the public-key to verify that the person that signed it has control over the addresses that are sending Bitcoin without anything other than math. Here’s the key point I’m getting to:\nIf someone has a private-key associated with a Bitcoin address, they can move all of the funds controlled by that address with impunity, and no one can stop them.\nThis has a few consequences that get at the heart of why people care about this technology so much:\n You never actually hold “Bitcoins;” you hold the keys that “sign-off” on moving them around the public ledger (blockchain). Whoever has access to the private-keys of an associated address has access to the Bitcoin at that address. No one else.  Let’s complicate things a bit So you can generate a key-pair at will with ease, and it is encouraged in the Bitcoin community to generate a new key-pair and address for every transaction. This drastically lowers the barrier of entry to participating in this ecosystem, as well as increases personal transactional privacy, but over time it becomes difficult to keep track of the many key-pairs and their addresses. Two quality-of-life improvements were then introduced to help this: Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets and Mnemonic Code Generation. This is how modern cryptocurrency wallets generate, manage, and backup the keys they hold.\nMnemonic Code Generation In a nutshell, this improvement gives you a human readable (and thus memorable) way of creating a random number. Instead of trying to write down/store/remember a really long number (or its hex-representation), you can, instead, use a series of words in a particular order. The ordering of words is then uniquely mapped to a random number through an algorithm to create a private-key.\nIf you’ve used one of the many popular cryptocurrency wallets, they tell you to back this up and save it in a safe location. We’ll talk about this more later.\nHierarchical Deterministic Wallets Using some tricks with cryptography and elliptic curve mathematics, a method to generate a tree of key-pairs from a single key-pair was introduced to help with the management/storage/backup of all the addresses a user has.\nThis enables users to focus on the security and storage of a single key-pair while simultaneously having the flexibility to use as many key-pairs as needed. This also allows for easy recovery or portability, as you only have to enter a single private-key into a new wallet to restore all of your accounts.\nPutting it together When we combine these two things, you end up with an easily memorable word combination (called a seed phrase, recovery phrase, backup code, etc) that can be used to generate any number of key-pairs. It should be stressed that this seed phrase now is the most important thing to keep safe, as whoever knows it has the ability to access and send funds from any of the private-keys that it generates.\nThat’s the basis of how modern wallet software generates, stores, and manages private-keys. There are more subtle details involved, but the security implications of it all is just about the same. Most notably, the seed phrase gives access to everything, and the key-pairs it generates gives access to the associated addresses. How these things are stored and who has access to them needs to be considered.\nSome Important Tidbits Custodianship Some companies that offer services in the cryptocurrency or blockchain industry require users to send funds to them, or to an address associated with the user’s account on their platform. They then manage the private-keys on behalf of the user. Because they physically control the access to the private-keys associated with an address, they are the custodians of the funds controlled by those accounts. A user is trusting the company to not steal the user’s funds as well as manage the security of keeping those keys safe and secure from attackers.\nPhishing An important consequence of decentralization technology is that it gives the end-user more power and control over personal data. With that comes the risk and responsibility of keeping it safe from those who should not have access. Because of this, the main method of attack in the space is to try and steal credentials through phishing.\nIn a nutshell, phishing is an attempt to artificially recreate your login or authentication screen in order to steal your username/password to gain access your account. If you are going to use a WebApp or service to store or send crypto, you are opening yourself up to potentially being phished. Once again, if someone gains access to wherever your private-keys are stored, they can steal everything with no way of getting it back.\nFor more information on phishing and how to protect yourself from it, here is a blog post from the MyCrypto team:\nHow to Avoid Getting Scammed and Phished · Security \u0026amp; Phishing | MyCrypto Help \u0026amp; Support\nSecurity \u0026amp; Phishingsupport.mycrypto.com\nQuestions to help guide better decision-making Ok, now you know a few things about how keys are made and used. You should now be able to comprehend conversations about management of private-keys. This also arms you with some knowledge to make more informed decisions, most importantly, how you manage the private-keys associated with the cryptocurrencies that you hold. There is a lot more to learn, but this should give you a wide base of understanding.\nThere is a wide array of options available to you, and what works for your situation depends on a lot of factors. There is no single solution for everyone and everything\nThis decision-making process usually boils down to trade-offs among security, accessibility, and trust. A realistic scenario is having various places and methods for storing crypto which are each optimized based on the type of fund. Think about it: should you treat your walking around money the same as your life savings?\nKeeping funds on an exchange If you’re regularly trading then you’ll need access to your funds quickly. Even though cryptocurrencies have drastically decreased the time required to deposit/withdrawal funds, it still could take up to a few hours when everything is working as intended. That could mean you miss the opportunity you were looking for depending on your trading style. That said, decentralized exchanges and safer methods of using exchanges without using their custodial services is getting better over time. A good way to evaluate this is to ask yourself whether you need to move what is stored in an exchange within the response time of an hour or so. If not, then it is probably best to take it off the exchange and put it into something more secure. Here are some more questions you should ask yourself:\n Do you trade often? Is it a substantial amount of money for you? Does your account have 2FA (two-factor authentication)? Is it enabled? Does the exchange have a good track record of customer support? What happens if there is a problem and you need to contact them? Are you ok with trusting someone else with the private-keys associated with this crypto? What benefits could there be associated with leaving funds there? How much would your life be affected if the exchange disappeared overnight? What confidence do you have that this won’t happen?  Keeping funds on your personal devices This is a vast middle-ground when it comes to storing private-keys. It can range from an encrypted vault on an air-gapped machine to having the same seed-phrase initiating wallets on all of your devices for “synced wallet” functionality. The benefit here is that you are in full control over your private-keys. The shortcomings are usually associated with shitty security practices (from either/both the user and the wallet software), and how difficult it is to properly secure a personal device from outside attackers, especially if that device is always on the internet. Here are some questions to ask yourself:\n Are your personal security practices up to snuff? Have you audited the devices that are storing the private-keys? Who else would have access to this personal device? Are you savvy enough to handle the potentially obscure wallet software? How would your life be affected if your personal device was lost or stolen? Do you know how the wallet software stores the private-keys it manages for you? Are they at least encrypted?  Keeping funds on a hardware wallet Hardware wallets are currently the best way to store and maintain your private-keys, as they are reasonably accessible while never exposing the digital keys to the cess-pooly internet. That said, in order to access the funds, you will need to physically have this device — perhaps annoying for small purchases and potentially dangerous if you’re storing very large amounts (the rubber-hose approach). I usually keep the funds that I do not need to access much on hard wallets, and then make sure I securely store those hardware wallets and their associated seed phrases. Here are some questions to ask yourself:\n How often do you need to access these funds? Have you safely stored your seed phrase? Are you using the same seed phrase somewhere else? (If so, you’ve negated any security guarantees the hardware wallet has and downgraded it to the lowest security storage method.) Did you buy it from a reputable source? Only go through official retailers for the device you’re buying. Never buy a pre-initiated device; if you receive one, remove the funds from it and re-initiate it with a fresh seed-phrase.  Shameless self-promotion So you’ve made it this far — well done. I hope that you’ve learned some valuable information to help you make better decisions on how you’ll interact with this amazing new technology. It isn’t easy, but it’s continually getting easier. When storing crypto, continuously think about where and how the private-keys are stored, who could gain access to them, and how you’d mitigate that. Balance that with how easily you’d like to access those funds.\nAs always, you can catch me, my co-hosts, and a wonderful community of individuals who support The Bitcoin Podcast Network in our Slack group.

I think that most of these comments are founded in false assumptions, which inevitably lead them to false conclusions. That’s a deep amount of work, which requires some groundwork first. This is some groundwork, so this is about abstracting away some of the roles Proof of Work (PoW) plays in blockchain protocols, and looking at how randomness is at the heart of them, and where that randomness comes from. Hopefully in later articles I can get into some PoS implementations and how they relate. Note: “Chaos” is probably a more apt technical definition than “Randomness” in the context of this article, but it is sufficient, and people are more comfortable with the idea of randomness, and not so much with chaos theory.\nWhat you should take away from this article: What role does randomness play in PoW blockchain’s consensus protocol, and how is it manifested.\nI’d also like to thank Bo, Evan Van Ness from Week in Ethereum, Rick Dudley, and my amazing crew at The Bitcoin Podcast for reading through this and giving me comments.\nNow let’s start There are two fundamental parts of “blockchain technology.” I might argue myself that there is a more fundamental part, call it part 0, that is the users of the system, but let’s not dive down into that hole for right now.\n The Blockchain Data Structure\nThis is exactly how the data is put together on computers. When using a “blockchain” data structure, this typically refers to using cryptographic hashes to link the ordering of atomic units (usually called “transactions”). The key idea is that because all information is cryptographically linked, you can pass around the resultant hash ( a SMALL amount of data) of the current state of the blockchain for agreement (a LARGE amount of data), which is both efficient and tamper evident. The Consensus Procedure\nThis is exactly how a group of (potentially adversarial) entities in a network come to agreement on the same data structure, while also deciding on who gets to edit or add onto it.  “Mining” is the basis of 2. while also throwing in other things like validation, asset supply control, and incentivization. The fairness of mining is crucial to the network operating in a trustless manner, which is enabled by PoW. In a very short sense, a miner will apply real world computational resources to try and solve the PoW puzzle. If successful, they gain the right to submit the next block. If they followed all the rules (validated transactions properly), and submit their block to the network before every other miner, their block gets added by the entire network, they get rewarded with the native asset of the blockchain (and some transaction fees), and everyone starts over trying to add the next block.\nThat is, they use external scarcity for the chance to gain native scarcity in a provably fair way. PoW allows for the automatic democratization of who gets to add to the blockchain while simultaneously providing succinct proof that the submitter pre-allocated a non-trivial amount of resources to gain those rights of submission. This process is typically referred to as “leader selection.”\nIt is important to realize that PoW is solely based on a hash function, and our trust of this hash function acting as a source of randomness.\nIt’s all about “Randomness” Turns out, the trustlessness of PoW blockchain protocols comes from our trust in the effective psuedo-randomness of a cryptographic hash function, and our current computational inability to break it. Let’s start by defining some crucial properties of a cryptographic hash function:\n The hash size is fixed\nThis means that no matter how big the piece of data to be hash is, the resultant hash is always the same size. It is a one-way function\nThis means you can only get a hash from data, and not data from a hash. This is the part people would LOVE to break in cryptography. This is hard to break with current and near-future computers. Eventually, general purpose quantum computers will be able to crack this property, but that’s not for a long time. It is efficient\nThis means that calculating a hash from data doesn’t take much computational time or effort. It doesn’t make sense to compare hashes if the time it takes to create the hashes for comparison is about the same time it would take just to compare the original data. The resultant hash is unique\nThis means that if the data to be hashed is different, then so is the hash, always. This allows a hash to be like a fingerprint for a piece of data. It is chaotic\nThis means that if you change the data, even in the slightest, minuscule way (like changing a single letter in an encyclopedia), the hash will be changed in a non-deterministic way and will be completely different.  The last property is where our randomness comes from in PoW. The chaotic nature of what a resultant hash looks like is solely what allows PoW to function properly. This assumption of randomness is why we can say if you throw more computational effort at calculating hashes, you have a better chance of “mining a block” in bitcoin, because your spending more energy to make more random guesses than the next guy.\nPoW mining is adding a nonce (just a number) to the hash of their candidate block’s header, and seeing if the resultant hash is below a target number which is called the difficulty. At a surface level, this means the hash has (at least) a certain number of zeroes at the beginning of it. If it does, they’ve won! If it doesn’t they change the nonce and try again, on repeat, until they get it or someone else does. What is important here is if the resultant hash isn’t random or can be gamed, then the whole thing falls apart.\nBy increasing the difficulty (number of required zeroes at front of resultant hash), you increase the average number of attempts someone has to try to get the desired hash, which corresponds to a real world amount of energy and resources being applied. This amount of energy is basically an entry ticket to play the game of securing the network. If you aren’t following the rules, your energy is wasted.\nBecause we can now simply rely on the PoW proof when blocks are submitted, PoW blockchains apply the rule of “the longest chain wins.” It doesn’t matter who submitted what; As long as that chain spent the most external resources and follows all the rules, it is deemed the correct chain. This is a direct consequence of our trust on the randomness of the underlying hashing algorithm. To reiterate, PoW blockchains like Bitcoin elect the first valid leader automatically, without question, because it is assumed they spent the appropriate amount of resources to incentivize them to play by the rules.\nLiberties granted because PoW has this trusted randomness: Because we can reliably know that a block-submitter has also put forth a substantial amount of real world resources, it affords us a few other things (non-exhaustive):\n Methods of Inflation/Incentivization A completely open network Automated leader election Mitigating the issue of a dropped leader  So let’s take that away: This is where things get tricky for PoS protocols. They no longer have an exterior resource to put at stake up front to try and win the game. If we take the PoW puzzle away, PoS has to try and fulfill the following roles in consensus:\n How to properly elect people to submit candidate blocks How to weight the vote of validation Agreeing on the “correct” chain  If a PoS protocol can sufficiently answer these problems through game theory, cryptography, and mathematics, then it could potentially drastically improve the efficiency in which blockchain consensus is done.\nWhat to do from here?

I hope others find these useful.\nNote: These are not meant to be complete. This is just a summary of my thoughts as I go through a blockchain technology that I’m not already familiar with. I hope that if I say something wrong, or information that answers one of my problems is brought up in the comments below. As always, more information is always better than less, just come with evidence. Also, THIS ISN’T INVESTMENT ADVICE.\nToday, we’re looking at Cardano (ADA), a platform claiming to be the next big thing and based on academic study of blockchain philosophy. It’s current market cap (as of Dec. 19th, 2017) is $11,802,780,321, the 7th highest of all. It has received a meteoric rise lately, which is probably why many are asking me about it. Market capitalization (especially in crypto-land) and its movement is not always a good indicator of project health, but it sure does bring attention to coins quickly.\nHere’s some quick pros vs cons that come to mind as I peruse their material.\nPros:\n They are based out of IOHK which is a resource I’ve often looked to for thinking about how blockchains should work and the formal breakdown of the algorithms that underpin things. The project was built from a mindset I use myself, from first principles. Start from the axiomatic truths you expect at the ground layer, and then formally build from there. Ouroboros is something I’ve research and am quite excited about as a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, and am curious to see it in action. I think that this is probably the best competing research with Ethereum’s Casper that currently exists, and I’ve read all (probably) of their papers. On the same development note, the Github has been active for a long time, with constant substantial code contribution. This is indicative of actual development, and not promise of future development. It is clear that work has been underway for a substantial amount of time, and not thrown together at the last minute like you would expect from a pump and dump. It is substantially novel in its approach to form “blockchain technology” (See the corresponding con as well). This means that it isn’t just a carbon copy of the networks we see today, with one difference to make it try and stand out. Blockchain technology has serious roadblocks in scale and effectiveness if we extrapolate to the usability we think this technology should handle. For a good outline on what those are, check out Preethi Kasireddy’s recent blog posts. She does an excellent job explaining them in a manner that’s approachable to all. She also was on our podcast to discuss these issues and more. As a PhD myself, I have an affinity for those that respect the peer-review process, and the rigor required to develop in a constructively critical environment. It seems as though those principles drive the development of every decision made thus far. There is a plethora of available information to learn more about how things work, and why the decision was made to do it that way. If I have a question, I feel as though I will be able to get at least surface level explanation to it, and if that isn’t sufficient, enough information to figure out who to ask. I enjoy infrastructure level technology at this point in the entire blockchains space. This is very much infrastructure level.  Cons:\n The meteoric rise in market cap is not indicative of the current state of the tech. I think it is clear that people have jumped into something they don’t understand because the website looks good, and they’ve outlined the things they want to do. The team seems as competent as any, but the fact of the matter is that it doesn’t exist yet and hasn’t stood the test of time and usage. The design decisions of how this technology will work is substantially different than any of the networks that are live now, which means that we have no idea of how well it will actually work in practice once under load and real adversarial actors are trying to game it for their personal benefit. Serious flaws may have not been exposed. Remember, ALL of blockchain technology is novel, and we’re all experimenting with what works. I believe this team has taken many steps to learn from valuable lessons from what currently exists, as indicated by the academic papers publish, but we simply can’t know if it will work yet. I’m not sure you can call this a con, but the distribution of a large amount of tokens in the genesis block is not something I enjoy for an open infrastructure level platform. I need to look more into it, and the site that discusses it is very transparent. I’ve aways said that if a network provides value and utility that doesn’t exist elsewhere, then the creators should be heavily rewarded, so this isn’t that hard of a con barring no serious issues that I haven’t seen yet. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to be done to get to what they want to be. This certainly isn’t impossible, especially with a massive influx of capital and talent that comes from investors and project relationships. They seem to have a quantitative method for identifying how far these things have come in their roadmap page. Not sure how they’ve figured that out, but it looks pretty.  All-in-all, I’m quite excited about this platform. This is a simple cursory look at whether or not I would want to dive deep and keep track of this project. Short answer, I’ll probably be divesting a good portion of my attention into it, and possibly trying to contribute where I can. I fact, full disclosure, I even bought some during the writing of this post. The fact that I had been reading IOHK’s papers for a long time now makes me a bit annoyed that I didn’t see this coming a while ago, but whatever. This space moves incredibly fast and there’s too much going on to watch everything.\nIf you like these types of shotgun opinion pieces, hit the “clap” button to let me know. I’m interested to hear your opinions on Cardano, what I got right, what I got wrong, or what I didn’t get at all.\nStuff about me I do this because I’m curious, and people ask me a lot of questions about things I don’t know. If I’m going to spend the time to look into attempting to answer them with any rigor whatsoever, I might as well try and give access to as many people who ask the same things. There’s a lot going on in this space, quickly, and not enough people trying to inform interested parties about it. Also this has the added benefit of maybe getting corrected if I’ve made a mistake in my surface level analysis.\nAs always, come listen to The Bitcoin Podcast and BlockChannel to hear me talk to people in the space about what they’re doing. Our slacks (TBP and BlockChannel) are always welcome to the community as well. I’m always present in them to talk.\nI bought using the Binance exchange. I’ve been pretty happy so far with it.

I am always weary of words like “can’t” and “never,” and when I find myself using them, I make a concerted effort to analyze why.\nIt turns out, people (as well as me) are saying these things with the presumption that they should behave like things they already understand. They are seeing Blockchain through the lens of traditional systems and how they behave, because those are the archetypes they have of the world. Our worldview is strictly defined by the tools we use to understand and explain it. This concept is certainly not new. In fact, the most popular variant was coined as “the law of the hammer” by Maslow in the mid 1900’s, which states:\n If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail\n The main idea of this is to warn from being narrow-minded. If you limit yourself to explaining the world with only the tools you’re comfortable with, you can quickly cut yourself off from a more complete description of what is going on. Even worse, you could completely get it wrong.\nThis becomes interesting if you take this idea, and apply it to how humans develop drastically new, innovative ideas. We, as a species, have spent an inordinate amount of time perfecting this pursuit. We call it science. It is notoriously difficult, slow, subtle, and cumbersome, but has lead to how we view the vast universe around us, and especially how we interact with it. The scientific method is the framework that pushes the boundary of human knowledge and understanding, but from the standpoint of Maslow, we are hammering the shit out of nature because the proper tool doesn’t yet exist to us.\nIn effect, we’re hammering the water in a pool and getting mad at the people next to us saying that isn’t going to work.\nThinking about genuinely new concepts is hard.\nUnfortunately, because Blockchain and all its incarnations is an entirely new, completely innovative technology, we don’t have the experience, frame of reference, or developed tools to properly think about it. We are currently stuck using the tools of yesterday to describe a technology of tomorrow, because that is what is natural and easy to do. Unfortunately, the tools we have are incomplete because we’re describing something that transcends their scope of abilities.\nI think the most elucidating way to highlight how our tools shape our perception is to discuss the history of mankind’s most innovative idea, Quantum Mechanics. I will not focus on details of quantum theory, it is beyond the scope of this post. This will instead be a broad, quick and dirty, overview of our conceptual evolution of nature, and how the tools of the trade played a role.\nThe Quantum Example: Is Light a Particle or a Wave? Before Quantum Mechanics was discovered and developed, we had a different sets of rules that governed how the world around us operated, and they were well compartmentalized and satisfying. This was called Classical Mechanics, and people were pretty sure at the time that they got it right, except a few pesky areas that needed resolving (we’ll get back to these pesky areas later).\nThe world that Classical Mechanics described was governed mainly by two different sets of mathematical tools. The mathematics of describing particles, which is how you figure out where planets will be, where a cannon will shoot a cannonball, what happens when a car hits a brick wall, etc. Essentially, the energy of the system of interested was confined to a areas in space, and the math showed you how that energy moved about. The other was the mathematics of describing waves. This describes how ripples move through a liquid, how strings vibrate, and how sound travels through air. This set of mathematics describes the way energy can be spread across a medium continuously, and how it moves within that medium.\nThese two sets of mathematics did a great job explaining the world, for the vast majority of things we as humans tried to study. The universe was made up of waves and particles, and we developed an awesome toolbox of mathematics to describe both of those things, and all was good. The physicists of the time thought they were super smart, and figured out how to describe the world around them like the bad-asses they were. Only thing left was to just quickly figure out those little pesky areas that weren’t figured out yet, and then the description of the universe would be complete. Confidence was super high, the struts and arrogance were real.\nOne of those pesky areas was describing light. You know, that stuff the sun makes, and lightbulbs, etc? Was light fundamentally a wave or a particle? There became two competing camps that thought light was a particle or a wave. These scientists developed experiments to prove they were right. The wave scientists designed experiments to show how light behaved like a wave, using all the tricks of the trade they developed from wave mathematics. The particle scientists did the same. They used all the clever particle mathematics tricks to design experiments to prove that light behaved just like a particle. Herein lies the interesting part:\nThey all worked.\n…\nWhat? How can they both be right? How can light be both a wave and a particle at the same time? It turns out, light is neither and both at the same time, because it transcends the concepts of waves and particles, thus the tools and intuition that describes those things. The nature of light is more than a particle or a wave, so the tools scientists developed to describe waves and particles could never fully explain it. This is typically encapsulated in the canonical experiments and studies around “The Dual Slit Experiment” (google it).\nThis realization shook the foundation of our understanding of the world around us, and Quantum Mechanics was developed as a better mathematical model to explain the experimental phenomenon, and it worked REALLY well. But was difficult, and people were incredibly hostile towards it, because it shook the foundation of the ideology they created rooted in the old models. The universe was completely new and bizarre, and didn’t make sense. People didn’t like that, and they fought it tooth and nail, even Einstein.\nLet’s Make Some Connections Now When I see arguments and attacks on what Blockchain technology is for, it is incredibly reminiscent of the arguments of whether light was a wave or a particle. People clutch to their worldview and experience of a traditional system, which I call a “lens” in how they see the world around them, and use it to describe this new technology:\n “Blockchain is a store of value!” “No, it’s a medium of exchange!” “It was designed to be a central source of truth!” “It’s clearly best for immutable history, bro.” “Privacy guys, PRIVACY!”  Well… in my opinion, everyone is right and wrong at the exact same time. The invention of Bitcoin brought together multiple traditional technologies and married them together to create something ultimately more general than any of its components. We’re now experimenting with this brand new way of doing things to see how to make it better, and it’s called Blockchain.\n Using any of the traditional toolsets to describe this new technology has value, but it is fundamentally incomplete.\n Just like the mathematics of waves was incomplete (but useful) in describing the nature of light, the traditional tools people use for description and reasoning are incomplete (but useful) in describing Blockchain.\nWe’re currently spending more time arguing on who’s right using weapons of antiquity to defend ourselves. Instead, we should be looking for “The Quantum Mechanics of Blockchain,” A more complete description of a new transcendent technology, which is a generalization of all the tools used to describe the parts that make the whole. This will help transcend how we view the world around us, and usher a new beautiful means of human communication using computers.\nI hope after reading this, you question the toolset you use to describe this space, and exactly how much you cling to it for comfort. Are you holding a hammer, getting mad at those telling you hitting the surface of a pool isn’t going to do anything useful? Are you a wave or particle scientist screaming at the opposite that your experiments work and that you’re right? What tools do you use to describe Blockchain, and what effect does that toolset have on your opinion of its purpose?\nIf that worldview is taken away, how scared are you?\n","description":"When reading about Bitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain, other alt coins, etc… (I’ll use capital B — Blockchain here to encompass them all) I hear…","id":11,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Getting Past the Golden Hammer with a Quantum Mechanics Example: A Valuable Lesson for Blockchain","uri":"http://coreypetty.com/posts/medium/corpetty/getting-past-the-golden-hammer-with-a-quantum-mechanics-example-a-valuable-lesson-for-blockchain-f254c289dad0/"},{"content":"Unlike most of my posts or writings, this is not a technical one. It borrows from the technical world a bit, but its purpose is more of a social endeavor.\nI’ve always had this amorphous construction in my head that I’ve used to think about what makes a person who they are. Why do they make the decisions they make and what makes them tick? I’m sure you’ve heard the term “everyone is a unique snowflake” or some form of that mentality. I believe that to be true.\nI’ve never been able to quite put it into an explainable framework, but I’ve always been happy with my ability to judge character, rationalize behavior, and generally accept and appreciate people for who they are. One of my favorite authors, Orson Scott Card, put my general mantra quite succinctly in his Enderverse series. I’ll bastardize it by paraphrasing:\n You can never be mad at something you truly understand\n It’s a beautiful idea that teaches someone to really try and understand something before casting judgement. The problem, of course, is the difficulty in understanding someone and all of the complexities.\nThis blog post is about fleshing out an idea, using the concept of a Merkle tree, to think about the complexities that make someone who they are. The analogy, as all analogies go, will be imperfect. I write this now in an attempt to flesh out how I view the world and the people I interact with. I can only hope that in the process of doing this, it helps the reader as well. Maybe you learn about Merkle trees, which would be win in my book.\nThis also provides a way of thinking about what a culture, race, background, time period, etc do to influence who a person is, and how all of these things come together to create something truly unique.\nHere we go…\nThe Fundamentals As always, we should start by defining the thing we’re using as an ideological construct, the all-mighty Merkle tree. This data structure is pretty much the basis of all variation in the current blockchain. People are now finding out novel ways of using Merkle trees and various data, as well as layers of Merkle trees to organize and summarize information efficiently.\nIf you already know how a Merkle tree works, skip this section.\nIn a nutshell, a Merkle tree allows someone to summarize an arbitrary amount of data in a specific order in a very efficient way, as well as efficiently prove that any datum (single piece of data) belongs in that data. This is done by iteratively summarizing pairs of datum together, then successively summarizing the summaries, until you get to a single piece left, which summarizes the entire set. This last piece, called the Merkle Root, is the summary of everything that went into it, but stored in a relatively small amount of information. Here is the obligatory schematic of such a process.\nQuick note, you should know that the size of each section is the same, regardless of where it is. That is, the size of the Root is the exact same size as the base layer. The sizes of the above boxes in the image are only different for illustrative purposes.\nA few important things to note about a Merkle tree:\n A Merkle Root is a beautifully succinct and unique representation of all the things that made it. If you change one thing in the tree, you completely change the root. This happens no matter how small the change, or where it happens.  These things get deep, but for the purposes of this post, that should be sufficient.\nThe Human Connection In my head, a human is just an amalgamation of many things: their genetics, race/culture, life experiences, decisions made, (soul?), etc.\nFrom a Merkle tree perspective, every single piece of data included has a substantial influence on the Root, the final result of that tree. Every single thing that happens to an individual has an influence on the root of who they are.\nWe humans love to group together, form cliques of us vs. them mentality, and attempt to guess what types of people will do based on various factors. While these endeavors are both constructive (social psychology) or destructive (racism), I think we lose site that an individual is incredibly complex, and no two people have gone through the same set of things in life, therefor they simply can’t be the same person.\nI like thinking of all of the factors that work together make someone as a Merkle tree. Each section being a branch in that tree that comes together to form the Individual at the Merkle Root. It reenforces the idea everyone has a unique perspective on life, and understanding it is valuable.\nSure, people from a similar background can have very close branches of influence, but the surrounding things that came together from individual experience can’t be copied, which results in different people. Making judgements on a person based on section of that’s persons tree is by definition incomplete.\nWhen you meet someone, you are introduced to the Root of their individuality, and are unaware of the countless number of things that created them. You can guess at what some of the branches are, but only through time and experience can you start to learn more about them, and get a better picture of what makes them unique.\nDon’t assume you understand someone when you’re only exposed to a few of the many branches that makes up their being.\nBringing it back around The idea of truly understanding someone is daunting, and from the Merkle tree perspective, impossible. Maybe that’s where this analogy breaks down. What I like about it is that is gives me a framework for appreciating that there is a lot that makes up a person. It makes me want to understand more about them so that maybe the more I learn, the more I can appreciate their uniqueness.\nHope you enjoyed my ramblings as I flesh out ideas that role around my head.\n","description":"Unlike most of my posts or writings, this is not a technical one.

The values refunded by the internal transactions are removed from the corresponding external amounts when grouped together. This is my dataset. All conclusions and numbers are derived from that.

Two-fold:\n They created a pool of “Genesis Tokens” (SGT) to give to early contributors that clearly showed they wanted to help the platform grow, which were given out at the discretion of the core devs. This token pool corresponded to a maximum of 10% of the total token supply. After the contribution period, SGT could be converted to the ICO token (SNT) so early contributors could “get in” on the ICO token for being a contributor early. Basically, early disbursement of tokens that map to a given percentage of the total. As for the crazy investors, they implemented a soft-cap, and subsequent “Dynamic Ceilings.” What is that? Well, you should read it from the people who implemented it here like a smart person, and then frown at my shitty explanation here. My explanation of Dynamic Ceilings, just imagine that as time went on, large investments only got a portion of their investment accepted, and the rest was refunded. This was an attempt to increase the time window for smaller investors, and slowly make it more difficult for large investments to get in. The effect of this was for every transaction that got an amount kicked back, there is one regular tx and two internal txs, for example ( numbers are for illustration ):  1.) User attempts to send 100 ETH\n2.) Over time, smart contract says \u0026ldquo;screw you big investor, give the little guys a chance!\u0026rdquo;\na.) Smart contract accepts 20 ETH\nb.) Smart contract refunds 80 ETH\n3.) User gets 20 ETH worth of SNT and 80 ETH refund\n** Note that percentages changed as time went on.\nHere are the stats I pulled from various sources, as well as my personal analysis of the transactions themselves.\n Start Block: 3,903,900 End Block: 3,908,029 Investment Time Period: 4,129 blocks or ~17.20 hrs Initial ETH Ceiling: 12M CHF (Franks, yo!) Total SNT Supply: 6,804,870,174.88 Total ETH Contributed: 299,343.15177772392  So this one got a bit hairy when summing up investor amounts from the smart contracts. You’ll notice (you probably didn’t notice) that I’m off by ~559 ETH from the reported numbers by the smart contracts themselves. This is because of the dynamic ceilings they employed.\nSo my analysis got a few of these transactions mixed up when combining external and internal transactions, which make my numbers slightly off, sue me (don’t). This annoys the shit out of me, but I don’t have the time to fix what went wrong. The trends will be the same, which is the main point of this article.\nTotal Supply Distribution: Below is the Status graphic from the previously linked Contribution article for your convenience.\nNote that the Status Genesis Allocation is “up to 10%.” Well, they didn’t actually give all of their allocation out, so the real numbers are as follows:\nStatus Genesis Token Holders: 6.92894026 %\nPublic Contribution: 44.07105974 %\nStatus Core Dev: 20 %\nReserved for Future: 29 %\nPublic Contributor Investment Distribution: The remainder of this article is discussing that ~44% piece, specifically on how much of the total supply these investors control, and their distribution. In other words, we’d like to see how well the ICO did in “spreading their seed,” if you will. Were they premature like the majority of highly popular ICOs, or did they pace themselves well despite the crazy excitement?\nEach unique address was summed up, giving its total contribution, and then placed into an “investor bin” that corresponds to how big of an investor they are. These bins are broken up by orders of magnitude of ETH, i.e.:\nInvestment (ETH): Bin:\n-\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-\n0 - 1 0\n1 - 10 1\n10 - 100 2\n100 - 1,000 3\n1,000 - 10,000 4\n10,000 - 100,000 5\nImportant Note: These value percentages are relative to the TOTAL SNT SUPPLY, which shows what type of investor has what control over the entire Status platform. Also, it should be noted that these numbers are only good for showing the distribution at the moment the ICO ended. More on this later. Here is the table of investors:\nand the plot:\n click the pic to blow it up click the link below to bring up an interactive version  We can see from the numbers that smaller amount investors have significantly more control of the token supply than previous ICOs that I’ve analyzed. This is a significant pullback from the trend of very few people controlling the vast majority of tokens, albeit the trend still exists.\nIt should also be noted that this does not take into account the extra ~7% of token holders that are early contributors to the platform.\nResponse Edit, thank you Nick Johnson and David Henderson: A few responses reminded me to point out that a unique address is not indicative of an individual, and such assumptions should not be made. I have discussed this in my TokenCard article, and did not include such a discussion. I guess it is prudent to say something.\nDue to the way the ICO was structured, the savvy investor was incentivized to break up his desired large contribution amount into many smaller addresses, and spamming them into the ICO to try and see what sticks. If enough of this happens, then you basically sybil (not quite sybil, but you get it) the ICO into a DoS situation, which is what we saw. I don’t have enough data to say how much of the network congestion was due to this, maybe someone else will do a sweet analysis of that.\nThere are some indicators that this was not the entire case, which you can read about in my response to Nick Johnson below, if you’re interested. There is another simple plot in there, for the people who just want eye candy.\nUltra Massive Exoneration Time! (a.k.a. opinions section) People are hating on Status for various reasons, which are mainly driven from garbage understanding of how the Ethereum network works, and misplacing blame.\nIt was clear the fervor was there. They were aware of it, and managed to raise a bunch money while still allowing “the little guys” en masse. You can’t really argue with that… look at the distribution.\nSo I believe that Status took steps in the right direction of both allowing smaller investors to contribute to an ICO, as well as being sure of putting tokens directly into the people that contributed early. This allowed people who actually helped build the system also take advantage of the ICO craze that is clearly going on. Full disclosure, I received SGT tokens for early contributions, which made me personally not inclined to participate in the ICO. I would predict that other SGT holders also felt this way, thus removing our would be transactions into the clusterfuck that was the contribution period.\nThe Dynamics Ceiling approach worked to keep a constant supply of incoming transactions of lower value over a longer period of time. The network congestion that people blame Status for is not their fault, unless you can blame them for building something MANY people wanted to contribute to.\nI talk at length about these network congestion issues raised from the ICO craze with MyEtherWallet’s Taylor one of my recent podcasts, take a listen:\nThe Bitcoin Podcast: TBP133 - ICO Woes with MyEtherWallet\n_Shortly after Ethereum launched, Taylor built MyEtherWallet.com with her partner because she wasn\u0026rsquo;t confident with…_thebitcoinpodcast.libsyn.com\nJust as a side calculation:\n Of all the transactions that tried to participate, the smart contract refunded 111,161 attempts for a total of 347,154 ETH.\n  Status refunded back more ETH than they raised.\n I’m not sure you can call that “greedy.”\nHolla at ya Boi! I do this because I’m curious, and feel this type of information is lacking. We need to keep an eye on “where the money comes from” as we build this community out.\nAs always, come listen to The Bitcoin Podcast and BlockChannel to hear me talk to people in the space about what they’re doing.

Christ folks. I’ve put off doing this one a little bit, in part because I’m a bit depressed/disappointed/confused/? in the direction this is headed. As always, I’ll leave my opinions until the end, so those of you who are strictly reading for the data herein can click “close” when I start ranting.\nThe Basic Attention Token ICO, lead by Brendan Eich, is an attempt to tokenize human attention on the internet. The ICO was certainly highly anticipated by the community, which I believe exacerbated the trends we’ve been seeing from the ICO space, as shown by my previous articles covering the Gnosis, TokenCard, and Aragon ICOs. Go read them, this one will cover that same information, and a bit more.\nHere is the summary on the ICO specifics:\n Desired Cap: 156,250 ETH Start Date: Block 3,798,640, approx. May 31, 2017, 8 am PDT Potential Investment Window: 30 days or until cap met Practical End Date: Block 3,798,642 (timeframe of 3 blocks) Technical End Date: Block 3,798,720 (small fry txs to get to cap) Total Supply of BAT: 1.5 billion Total BAT for Sale: 1 billion BAT Development Pool: 200 million User Growth Pool: 300 million  How’d I Do It? This was all done using Project Jupyter notebooks and the Pandas package. The transactions were retrieved using my Python bindings to the Etherscan.io API (tagging Matthew Tan). The methodology is very similar to my previous articles mentioned earlier, and the Jupyter notebooks of all of it can be found in a new Github repo.\nIn particular, I retrieved all transactions from the BAT contract address from Etherscan.io, and parsed out the ones that had an error or had a value of 0 ETH. This is my dataset. All conclusions and numbers are derived from that. That being said, the plots include all transactions, included the ones that had an error. I find it interesting to see the behavior of the contract with those that try and interact with it.\nThe Data! Let’s look at some stats from ICO:\n Total non-zero successful txs: 185 Total unique addresses: 184 Total tx fees paid: 70.15489 ETH Current num BAT holders: 2222 (as of June 5, 2017, 8:40 PM EST)  Practically speaking, the ICO was finished after 3 blocks. 99.9996% of the desired 156,250 ETH was put in by then. Below is a list of the top 10 contributors. The remaining successful txs are just people who asked for a small enough amount to get their transaction in.\nNote that some have said the large transactions were the team itself that were the reserved pools. THIS IS NOT CORRECT. These are investors buying from the Token sale. The reserved pool amounts are outside of the tokens that were for sale. Go look at the website, it clearly states the breakdown.\nSome lucky/smart bastard got two transactions in! His address is 0x001934d46ef025ec18f292f4c5f42ec85f2deb26 and here are the deets:\nOk, let’s look at the investor distribution, like we’ve done in the other breakdowns. Even though its a bit of a misnomer this time, it’s kinda my thing now, I guess. The first is the table, the second is the plot:\nWith only a few people getting into the ICO, its quite clear the vast majority of people who actually got to invest were large ETH amount contributors, and they were prepared.\nBefore I start my rants, if there is more data that you’d like to see in particular, leave a comment and I’ll try and add it. It isn’t that difficult for me to produce information from the raw data. If you’re capable, I invite you to do it yourself. You have access to what I’ve done and how I’ve done it through my github, use it, and answer your own questions! If you don’t know how, ask. I’d like to think this community has a strong desire to help others understand what we’re trying to build.\nThoughts on Trends in the Space, Some Warnings: Guys… what the fuck are we doing?\nIt’s quite clear that the trends of the ICO space are getting a bit out of hand. Yes, I’ve only done analysis on the largest ones, and it can be said that BAT is one of the most legitimate ones. Brendan Eich’s track record, the Brave Browser actually exists and is in use (I personally use it for about 30% of my internet browsing), The amount of press, time, and instruction the team gave investors. All of these helped contribute to its quick sell out.\n Selling all of your tokens to a few individuals is not the point.\n I think we can safely assume anyone that got into the BAT ICO isn’t planning on actually using BAT. I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that almost every single person who participated successfully is attempting to distribute the BAT they bought in order to make profits when they hit exchanges, taking advantage of the FOMO of these times.\nI’m cool with making a buck and smart investment strategy. I can’t really blame the people who are doing it here, it was clear that was going happen if anyone cared to look at past ICO results. I blame those creating the ICO terms. The number one rule of blockchains that involve value transfer is that if it can be gamed, it will be. If your goal is to distribute your token to those who are interested in what you’re trying to do, then it is your responsibility to structure your platform so that the people you’re trying to reach are able to reach you.\nSomething else of note. We have no idea if the people actually doing the ICO aren’t investing in their own platform and making a profit off themselves twice. I don’t see why they wouldn’t. (pure conjecture, but clearly a possibility)\nThere are negative consequences if we continue along this road, namely:\n The FOMO associated with very short window, high value ICOs will artificially inflate the value of the underlying project, and fund a project with far too much money as a start-up. This doesn’t align incentives to provide a quality product to the end-user. If you raise that much money as a start-up, you’ve won. What do you care? You are required to have an extraordinary amount of ethics to continue to the best of your ability. This artificially inflated sense of scarcity boosts the price, and thus the underlying valuation of the project which they can’t operate it. It strangles them. If the standard moves towards this behavior, we won’t allow people to do enough due diligence. Investors will just throw money at every project, hoping one will stick. This creates an environment that’s ripe for scamming or poor quality ideas getting funded. A shitty white paper is not enough for millions of dollars of an investment. Eventually, some of these projects will fail miserably, and people will lose a significant amount of money. More than likely, the majority of these projects will not be able to produce what the set out to, leaving their community holding a depreciating bag of shit.  I love the idea of a token that represents the API key to your platform, and as your platform grows, those that add value to it get rewarded. There are plenty of ways this new model of business is going to change the world, but we’ve started off on the wrong foot, and the investors and scammers are going to do everything in their power to ruin it for us. This road can potentially ruin us at the very worst, or just set us back for a long time when something inevitably goes wrong.\nMaybe I’m just being cynical, but I doubt it.

This time around, it’s with the Aragon Project, a play at making “unstoppable organizations on the blockchain.”\nNot gonna lie, I played with their Alpha release, and enjoyed it. It has potential to do some cool stuff. The goal of this article is not to critique the platform, but only to look at the distribution of Ethereum ICOs to help people see the trends of the space. You can draw your own conclusions and make your own speculations.\nICO Details:\n Started May 17, ~6pm GMT Started on block 3,723,000 Ended on block 3,723,134 (Last successful valued tx) Investment window 33.5 min ((3723134–3723000) * 15 / 60) See here for more specific details of how they plan to use the money and its vesting schedule, etc.  How’d I do it? This was all done using Project Jupyter notebooks and the Pandas package. The transactions were retrieved using my Python bindings to the Etherscan.io API (tagging Matthew Tan). The methodology is very similar to my previous articles on Gnosis and TokenCard, and the jupyter notebooks of all of it can be found in a new Github repo.\nIn particular, I retrieved all transactions from the AragonContract address from Etherscan.io, and parsed out the ones that had an error or had a value of 0 ETH. This is my dataset. All conclusions and numbers are derived from that. That being said, the plots include all transactions, included the ones that had an error. I find it interesting to see the behavior of the contract with those that try and interact with it.\nThe Data! Ok, from the dataset, we have the following:\n Total ETH raised: 274,989.993538 Total Transactions: 6593 Total non-zero txs: 2915 Total zero txs: 1830 Total error txs: 2093 Total unique addresses: 2616 Total out of gas txs: 651 ( worth 30509.78876345497 ETH )  No need to do a token breakdown, because they only accepted ETH. Other tokens were pushed through ShapeShift.io first if someone desired to use them. In fact, there were two addresses that showed an abnormally high number of zero value transactions calling the transfer function of the Aragon contract, listed below:\naddress: num_txs:\n0x5e575279bf9f4acf0a130c186861454247394c06 139\n0xfbb1b73c4f0bda4f67dca266ce6ef42f520fbb98 134 (Bittrex)\nThe second address listed is the Bittrex exchange, and the first isn’t listed on Etherscan. It is plausible to assign this address to another exchange, my bet would be Shapeshift. A more detailed analysis would show what portion of people invested through these two addresses, I didn’t look much further than what you see here.\nAs with my previous posts, I find it very interesting to group the investors in to bins relative to the size of their investment. That means if you are an investor and you donated between 0–1 ETH, you belong in bin 0. If you donated between 1–10 ETH, you belong in bin 1, etc. Here is a table of the bins and the stats associated with them:\nand as always, here is the bar chart plot of the same data:\nYou Got Your Tin Foil Hats Ready, it’s Conclusion Time! Ok, here we go again. The trend of very few controlling the vast majority of tokens. I feel like we can eliminate these large address as being exchanges as well, due to one of the two large tx volume addresses being linked to Bittrex as discussed earlier. Furthermore, the largest token holder:\naddress ETH num_txs\n0x83f04b8fd774a6474592e8670b9928a1344bbe38 30000.0 2\nhas no association to anything public. I believe we have organizations buying up DRASTIC amounts of ICO tokens for various reasons. Your speculation is as good as mine (maybe better).\nWe are also implementing ICO’s that only let incredibly ready people participate, leaving the rest in the dust. Looking at the very first large transaction, an investment of 17670 ETH was made almost immediately, with funds being pulled from both Kraken and Bittrex. This guy (girl/group/etc) knew what he was doing, and got in on the first block available.\nAlso note-worthy, despite the instructions specifically stating that you needed to include at least 200,000 gas, there were 651 txs that errored out because they didn’t include enough, which accounted for over 30k ETH. Maybe the next ICO, and the functionality around interacting with them can learn from some of these lessons, making it easier for the little guy (like ME!) to have a reasonable time window to participate with relative ease.\nAll in due time I guess…\nHelp a Brother Out I do this because I’m curious, and feel this type of information is lacking.

Monolith Studio’s TokenCard is a platform to hold your ERC20 tokens, as well as spend them using a visa debit card. Their whitepaper can be found here. We at The Bitcoin Podcast did a highlight of them a while back (found here). This post is not an evaluation of the platform, but more of a look at the public perception of the platform, and how the TKN digital asset will be distributed amongst the community (initially).\nTokenCard ICO contract address: 0x49edf201c1e139282643d5e7c6fb0c7219ad1db7\nHere is the Medium post detailing the ICO details and instructions.\nMy Methodology I used my python bindings to Etherscan.io API, together with Pandas DataFrames, plotly’s API, and Project Jupyter notebooks to create this information.\nI’ll send you the notebook upon request.\nI looked at the ICO address given above, and pulled all external transactions using into a Pandas Dataframe. These transactions can be viewed online if you click the Etherscan.io link provided above.\nI did not do an analysis for each token, only on the ETH transactions. This means that the actual numbers in terms of total investment and distribution will be a bit skewed from the ones reported here. It is assumed that the overall behavior is similar for all token investments. This subset makes up the lion’s share of the total investment, so the behavior established by this analysis is extrapolated to other coins as well.\nHoller at me if you have a problem with my methodology. I’m not getting paid for any of this, so if you want a breakdown across all tokens and their relative differences… incentivize me (ETH and BTC addresses at the bottom ).\nThe Data Over All Tokens: Below is a table showing the relative contributions from each digital asset accepted. The value column is the amount of the respective token invested, and the evaluated column is the USD valuation of the token amount (at 78.36 USD/ETH).:\nThis information in bar chart form is as follows:\nFrom the above information, we can see that TokenCard raised a total of 16,722,425.36 USD, with ETH accounting for 77.91% of the total.\nAs stated in the Methodology section, we now move on to only look at the ETH bar from the above information. One can make a case that because ETH makes up such a large percentage, its distribution can be seen as a representative subset of the total distribution. One can also argue to the accuracy of this assumption, but this post is to give a quick look at the distribution of investors (and Etherscan.io doesn’t expose the token transactions in their API, yet, making getting at them slightly more difficult).\nA Time-series Look at the ICO: Below is a plot of the individual investments as a function of time, broken up by successful and failed transactions.\nNote that the interactive version contains the successful transactions and failed transactions. You are also capable of zooming and spanning the plot for a better view. I’d love it if I could embed these in Medium sometime.\nLike the other breakdowns I’ve done, I’ve found it useful to break up the transactions into groups of investors, with each larger group bin being an order of magnitude larger than the previous. In other words:\n group 0: 0–1 ETH group 1: 1–10 ETH group 2: 10–100 ETH group 3: 100–1,000 ETH group 4: 1,000–10,000 ETH group 5: 10,000–100,000 ETH  Here is the breakdown of the individual groups, exp_group is the group number as defined above, value is the amount of ETH in the group, size is the number of unique addresses in the group, and the other two are the respective percentages.\nAnd of course, the bar chart version of this information:\nAlthough this is not as drastic as what we saw in the Gnosis auction, we still see a large percentage of TKN sold to only a few investors.\nSome Conclusions Drawn This is where I discuss what I think, based on the numbers above. Agree with me or not? Cool.\nWhat this doesn’t show:  This shows only unique addresses, not the identity of the people or people’s associated with them. That means that multiple individual addresses could be a single person or persons, or a single address could be a single person or a very large company. It is more likely that the latter is the case, considering there is no immediately perceived incentive to spreading out the TKNs across multiple addresses (like there would have been for TheDAO). In fact, you increased your chances of failure if you attempted multiple investment transactions, considering the small timeframe in which it was finished. Exchange participation. I have not made an attempt to identify the large addresses, and cross reference them against a known list of exchange addresses. If one were interested, Etherscan.io has address tagging, and keeps a record of most large exchange addresses. One could do this within a small timeframe, but I didn’t. Knowing that a few of the large participants in the ICO are exchange addresses further decentralizes the investor distribution, giving more control to smaller investors than what is immediately perceived by the charts above.  Based on the information above, we can see a continuation of the trend in ICO behavior. That is, the majority chunks going to a few participants, barring availability to many potential investors. If one were to click on the interactive link of the timeseries plot, they’d notice the long tail of failed transactions from would-be investors that got there too late.\nFrom the failed transactions, we can also see that even the incredibly large investors don’t quite get the tech right the first time too, which is a scary thought. We see two failed transactions of the same quantity. This hints that the tech is still difficult to get at, further isolating the pool of would-be investors to people who have a high-threshold level of knowledge about participating using this tech. We’re still growing, building infrastructure to make this available to the general public, but as we do so, we are still a small community of people who actually get this stuff.\nThe short time windows of the recent ICOs show that they are a hot commodity, but its at the cost of allowing everyone interested to participate. 30 minutes of participation availability is quite small. Yeah, its great to the ICO holders, but at the cost of some of the ideals in the space, namely decentralization.\nI have a feeling that the people who build these platforms and have ICOs to fund themselves have a certain vision for how things progress, but are ultimately under the control of large capital investors and market manipulation. These trends could be seen as people with money making artificial scarcity and desire of a platform during early ICOs in order to make a profit when the tokens go into market via exchanges. This could lead to a disregard of actual fundamentals in the platform, giving people false belief in the actual viability of a platform’s ability to do the things they say they want to do.\nI’m not saying TokenCard can’t do what they want to do. I actually enjoyed talking to Mel Gelderman in our interview, and am very excited to see TokenCard succeed in the future. I’m only nervous about the trends we’re seeing in the ICOs being done in our ecosystem, and their overall effect of adoption blockchain technology.\nHelp a Brother Out I do this because I’m curious, and feel this type of information is lacking.

I’m not too terribly surprised, to be honest, it was an incredibly popular project in the space.\n$12.5 million in less than 15 minutes…\nI was too late, because I was fiddling around with other things, like my job. But this gave me a fantastic opportunity to procrastinate and dive deeper into who bought in. To be a bit more precise, what does the distribution of auction’s transactions look like, and what can it tell us?\nSo I found the Gnosis wallet address (here), and looked at its internal transactions, which added up to exactly 250,000 ETH. I’ll discuss what this does and doesn’t give later in the blog. What I have here is a simple overview of transaction distribution throughout the window in which the auction was open.\nBelow we can see the amount of ETH deposited into the address, separated by block number:\nWe can see that two of the blocks have the lion’s share of the investment, which begs one to see what the “user” distribution looks like. So then I broke up the individual investments in to separate categories. Each category is an investment in each order of magnitude of Ether.\nSo this plot shows us that over 40% of ETH invested in Gnosis was done by two single transactions. Since we are looking at the internal transactions of the contract address, it is not immediately apparent who they came from. Potentially exchanges, potentially Gnosis, potentially a super whale. More analysis would need to be done.\nThis plot also shows us that we are not so decentralized as a community, which needs to be kept in mind. As with most high level investments, the majority comes from a relatively small portion of the total pool of investors. It is important to note that investment opportunities are available to everyone now, as this is a technology of inclusion, but more than likely low-amount investors are simply along for the ride.\nWhat this information does NOT show Because I looked at internal transactions, I am not able to capture some phenomena, such as:\n multiple investments from the same party\nThis is typically in the form of a small amount first to test, and then the rest of the desired investment. We can assume that a good portion of the first group of people (transactions under 1 ETH) were exactly this. It is also interesting to note that because there was cap, and things went fast, it could be assumed that there is a non-trivial amount of people that got the first test transaction through, and then the auction ended before they could get the real one. Any real world identification of investors\nAll of the information captured here is internal, so the “from” field is always the dutch auction contract, and not those sending the initial transaction. Further investigation could link the two, but this is quick and dirty, and I don’t have the time to do that (unless you pay me to ;) ) Other stuff I don’t feel like discussing\nThis was just a curiosity of mine that I thought others would be interested to see. If you have questions or concerns on the conclusions I’ve drawn from the data, or how I plotted things, let me know and I’ll address them if they aren’t too trollish.

I am not a Rust coder, but I have experience with low-level programming languages (Fortran, C), and high-level scripting languages (Python, R, Bash), so I feel I have a pretty good idea what’s going on.\nIt is important that everyone understand what the code is doing, regardless of whether or not they can read code. If you catch a mistake, LET ME KNOW, so I can change it. This is an open invitation to code nazi’s to correct my description, something you people don’t get very often.\nIn all, Gavin submitted changes to 3 files in the Parity client: account.rs, ethash.rs, and states.rs. We’ll go through each one separately.\naccount.rs The account.rs file has two sections with additions to it. He creates a function, and then creates a test for that function (good programming practices) Let’s start with what that function does.\nFirst off, we can see that this is inside the Account structure, which means that anything written here becomes a variable or function attributed to a created account. For example: `account.balance` would yield the account’s balance.\n Line 111: A comment specifying what this function is supposed to do. This function is supposed to change a given account’s programming code with a given programming code. Line 112: Here we actually make the function definition of `reset_code` that takes all predefined variables and methods associated with the parent (Account) and the new code we want to implement, called `code`, as bytes. Line 113: Here we essentially delete the hash of the account’s old code, by setting it to `None` Line 114–115: Now we re-run the function `init_code` with the new code we want to implement. `init_code` is defined elsewhere in the Account struct, and is passed to this function through the `self` object. The end bracket just ends the definition of our new function `reset_code`.  This section of changes is a test function to test the above newly defined `reset_code` function we’ve just talked about. I will skip the line-by-line definition of this part, because it isn’t adding new functionality. Please note that I am not discarding this as not important, it is incredibly important. It just isn’t new functionality, it is only checking to make sure the previously defined new functionality works as intended.\nethash.rs  Line 135: This creates a new function called `on_new_block` which takes in all variables and methods previously set on the parent `ethash` referred to as `self`. It also takes in the new block, and all its respective variables and methods called `block`. Line 136: This sets the block number in which the hard fork would take place in the future to a variable appropriately called `dao_fork_blknum`. Line 137: This sets the variable `main_dao` to the address of “TheDAO” for later use. Line 138: This creates a vector (list of things) of child DAO addresses called `child_daos`, which will be used later. Line 139: This sets a new variable `new_dao_code` which will eventually be filled with the contract code that will replace TheDAO’s original bugged code, to allow people to only retrieve their ether. Line 140: This line places a comment to remind people that something needs to be done here. In particular, a “check trigger function” needs to be placed here. Presumably to make sure everything has been set up correctly.\nPlease someone correct me here. Line 141: Here, if the header number of the new block is equal to the dao fork block number, then continue. Otherwise, skip. This is saying essentially do nothing until the predefined `dao_fork_blknum` has been reached. Line 142: Next, if you’ve reached `dao_fork_blknum`, check to see if the gas limit of the incoming block is less than or equal to 4,000,000. If so, continue to the next indented line. Line 143: assuming the previous line was True, then we define the variable `state` to be the same as the incoming blocks `state`. Probably just a way to not have to type out all that for later use. Line 144: This is the beginning of a loop, which incrementally goes through all child daos previously defined in `child_daos` and assigns the current selection in the iteration to the variable `child`. All further indented code will apply to the variable `child` until the end of the loop. You can think of this saying “apply the indented code to all things in our list of child daos.” Line 145: Here we define a new variable `b` set to the balance of the currently selected child dao, `child`. Line 146–147: We then transfer whatever funds that are in the child dao `child` back into the “TheDAO” (`main_dao`). The end bracket means its the end of the above loop, which means we’re finished with one iteration of the loop. We go back up to the definition, select the next child dao in the list, and do the same steps. The end effect of this loop is that all ether from all child daos are placed back into the main dao. Lines 148–151: Now that all funds are back in the dao, this line changes the byte code of the main dao to some new code `new_dao_code`. This code has yet to be determined, so this is essentially the skeleton of the hard fork, with the real meat to be determined. We saw the definition of this function `reset_code` previously.  state.rs  Line 211: This just changes wording of comments to be consistent with other changes. Line 217: This is a comment line letting us know what the new function is supposed to do. This new function is supposed to reset the code of account `a` (an input) to newly defined code `code` (also an input). Line 218: New function definition line. Note that the `self` of this change is NOT the same as the `self` we saw earlier. It is all the variables and methods that are associated with it’s parent, which in this case is the State struct. The previous `self` we just finished discussing was associated with the Ethereum Engine implementation, and the first `self` was associated with the Account struct. If this is confusing, ask and I’ll explain more. Line 219–220: This is a little more complicated of a line. This line will call the previously defined `reset_code` function we have already discussed, but if and only if the account meets certainly criterion. I would need a bit of help with this one. I have not dug deep enough before to understand the logic of what exactly `require_or_from` is doing. To speculate may lead to completely incorrect assumptions.  Despite the previous sentence, I will guess anyway. In essence, I believe this is simply making sure all things associated with the state of the EVM is properly checked and correct, before reseting the code of the account.\nI’ll update this as I receive corrections, and then reference to it when the actual new contract code for TheDAO is submitted, and I write about that. Enjoy\nEdits:\n changed “Solidity coder” to “Rust coder.” These changes are to the Parity client, which is programed in Rust, a low-level language that can be compared to Fortran and C, and not in Solidity, one of the languages used for creating smart contracts. — credit to /u/bernardoslr from reddit.

You’re about to be inundated with a large amount of coverage about all things crypto from many sources, and a lot of it will probably be garbage.\n An opinion is only worth the facts that are used to form it.\n In other words, if nothing concrete is backing the things coming out of your mouth, then you’re spewing bullshit, and your opinion doesn’t matter. I spend the majority of my time vetting the information I receive and trying to get to the bottom of things from a purely factual standpoint.\nSince raw data simply can’t be wrong, but the opinions that are derived from it can, we’ve created the #dao_data channel in The DAO slack to try and answer peoples’ questions about facts and dig deep into the blockchain to figure out what’s going on. If you care about these things, join us — we need more people who care.\nIf anything, those of us who are attempting to get to the bottom of this should coordinate so that we are not too redundant with our efforts.\nWhat happened? For those who haven’t quite figured out what happened, a known bug was taken advantage of to continuously extract more ether from the DAO than what the caller’s address has control of. The bug was labeled the “race-to-empty” bug (described in detail here) and The DAO noted and started working on it immediately (detailed here). They had already implemented a fix for DAO v1.1, but nothing was done to mitigate the risk until then, which is way more difficult than it sounds (probably, I’m not sure).\nIf you don’t feel like mucking through the weeds, this is a very subtle bug that presents itself between the translation step of someone writing in the “high-level” Solidity code that turns human-readable smart-contracts into the language that the computer wants, bleeps-and-bloops. If the human-readable code isn’t written VERY carefully, then the order in which things are done after that point may be handled slightly incorrectly, resulting in a very terrible accounting error.\nIf performed once, you can extract double what your address says you hold. But what if you nest the function calls inside of one another, so a function call essentially calls itself? You can create a loop that continues to extract the amount of money associated with your account before the contract ever gets a chance to zero-out your account balance and until you run out of gas (this is called recursion, look it up, it can be quite brain-racking).\nIf you DO want some weeds, here is an article describing things in more detail (with code). Make sure to read the comment section for any discrepancy between the article and possible typos.\nWho did it? For now, since it’s quite difficult to put a name or identity to a cryptocurrency address, I’ll just call the attacker(s) Mr. Fuckface (I chose Mr. cause I’m sexist, and women are awesome). Before I go into the details of Mr. Fuckface, I’d like to point out that other people are also looking deeply into this, including all actions leading up to the attack, as well as subsequent movement. Johannes Pfeffer, for one, is doing a fantastic job of visualizing this information, and his recent blog post (linked below) will be continuously updated as he learns more.\nThe rise of the Dark DAO\n_Today a new force has risen: “The Dark DAO”. Here, I will visually analyze what happened after 2016–06–17 03:34:48 UTC._medium.com\nMore of us are coordinating in the #dao_data slack channel to learn as much as we can.\nHere is the split proposal that was used to do the attack. You can find all addresses associated with the attack, who voted on it, etc, there. For those of you who don’t like clicking on things while reading an article, here is a list of the things you can find in just about every other “DAO attack article.”\n Creator of the childDAO (attacker): 0x4a574510c7014e4ae985403536074abe582adfc8 childDAO address: 0x304a554a310c7e546dfe434669c62820b7d83490 Two controllers of the childDAO:\n0xc0ee9db1a9e07ca63e4ff0d5fb6f86bf68d47b89\n0xf835a0247b0063c04ef22006ebe57c5f11977cc4  There are a few other addresses, one of which has sent a signed notice to the community threatening legal action if his “legitimate ether” is taken away from him (douche)… You can find that here.\nWhere do we go? There seem to be two main camps of solutions for going forward: A soft-fork solution or a soft-then-hard-fork solution. Let’s be clear here — these two solutions are talking about changing the Ethereum blockchain/mining software to fix The DAO’s problem.\nSoft Fork:\nThe soft-fork solution proposes to essentially lock the stolen funds so that they simply can’t be spent. It is a small update to the mining software in the Geth client that includes a flag which ignores submitted blocks with any trace of interacting with these funds. More specific details can be found here. The community (of miners) then decides whether or not they support this by enabling or disabling the flag. It should be noted that ALL ether are frozen, not just the stolen ones. This is an effort to at least stop any further threat to occur, and to give more time to discuss further options.\nHard Fork:\nThe hard-fork solution is a proposed next-step after the soft-fork to return all Ether in The DAO to its original owner. Essentially, it would hardcode all associated ether from the end of the DAO creation phase into a new contract which has only a single function: withdrawal. This, in essence, dissolves The DAO, wipes the slate clean, and moves forward, with almost zero-harm done (directly) to those who participated in The DAO experiment. Below is EthCore’s initial response and description, as well as Slock.it’s recent blog post describing the same things (as well as their opinions).\nAttack on The DAO: What will be your response?\n_Two days ago a flaw was spotted in the contract code of theDAO - specifically a recursive call issue that exists in the…_blog.ethcore.io\nWhat the ‘Fork’ Really Means\n_In the last 36 hours we have witnessed an attack on The DAO._blog.slock.it\nOthers have said we should do nothing because the underlying protocol should be agnostic to the applications that are built on top. Under this line of reasoning, if you build something that isn’t secure, you will suffer the consequences and pay for the resulting lessons. If you feel that way, either of these options still allows you to express that sentiment.\nYou can stop reading now if you don’t care what I think about any of this. I’ve tried to present everything so far without too much personal bias. Now I’ll tell you how I feel about it based on everything I’ve read and found.\nPersonal Opinions: Let’s start with the obvious: the attacker can go fuck himself. If you side with him, send me a link explaining why you think he’s right, and then I’ll actually go into detail on why you can go fuck yourself as well.\nIt appears Ethereum has grown up a bit, considering it has now found itself with a large problem and multiple roads to take for fixing it. The governance model of Ethereum will be tested here, and how things proceed will shape the view of Ethereum stability as a whole, which will, of course, be extrapolated to cryptocurrency as a whole by on-lookers.\nWe should tread carefully here.\nThe soft-fork “stop-gap” solution is elegant, and the proposed hard-fork solution is incredibly simple and straight forward as far as hard-forks go. It doesn’t rollback anything; it doesn’t change any way in which Ethereum fundamentally works; it doesn’t change anything that people on the Ethereum network have done, except with those who have interacted with The DAO.\nOn the other hand, doing a hard-fork sets a precedent for saving bad code. I am a token holder, and I want my money back, personally, but I also don’t want the message of Ethereum to be “write terrible code, don’t worry, we got you.” This is a valuable lesson in security, which should not be taken lightly. I put money into something I believed (and still do) will be the future of money. It had a fault, someone took advantage of it, and now we move on.\nFor the record, I still support the hard-fork solution simply because it is an elegant solution that ONLY thwarts Mr. Fuckface, and I’m for that. But from now on, we need to be MUCH more careful in how we go about the next DAO, because there most certainly will be one, and I will be part of it.\nDr. Emin Gün Sirer has recently written on the attack and how it relates to the concept of programming smart-contracts:\n “I believe that Ethereum, overall, will emerge from this in a few weeks, having been made much stronger as a result. It will have a newfound direction and charter that involves a slight pivot, away from “let’s get DApps at all costs, let’s make front-end programmers into smart contract writers,” towards “let’s build up the science of secure, smart contracts.”\n Thoughts on The DAO Hack\n_We just lived through the nightmare scenario we were worried about as we called for a moratorium on The DAO: someone…_hackingdistributed.com\nThis idea, the “science of secure, smart contracts,” is what I find to be incredibly important. The current culture of programming is to not worry about the details, but to create things that are pretty while using someone else’s framework. When dealing with multiple millions of dollars, we’ve got to do better. If anything, The DAO has shown us that subtle details must be taken into account when programming things that handle money, and we have to be sure that the contracts we create are doing the things we intend and nothing else.\nThings to Consider:  We need to look for abnormally large Ether shorts placed on exchanges around the time of the attack. The attackers underlying motivation could have been to simply short the price of ether. If he was smart enough to perform the attack, he was also smart enough to know he’d make huge waves, and not be able to touch his money quickly. We need to watch for abnormally large amounts of DAO tokens being gobbled up if The DAO stays alive. This seems to not be one of the current options, but if it does end up being one, the attacker’s initial motivation could have been to shake confidence, and then accumulate large amounts of a seriously large fund. It is shown in the history of the attacker’s addresses that they already controlled a large amount of ether. We need to watch the known addresses associated with the attack, and who they’re interacting with. Any interaction with known addresses gives us more information on Mr. Fuckface.  Some “No Shit” Things  Putting so much ether into a single contract was a risk. The outcome of this single event will affect Ethereum and cryptocurrency as a whole, forever. Some people are probably gonna lose some money because assholes exist.

If you’ve invested into The DAO, welcome to the largest crowdfunded/kickstarter/other “traditional analogy that doesn’t quite cut it” in history. The truth is, we’ve done something historical, and possibly game changing and foundational to how organizations pool and spend money (among other things). Let’s take some more time to look at who has invested, and how much has been put in, to see if we can draw some conclusions\nIn short: the more concise, truthful information that is put into more people’s hands results in more informed decisions. I speculate and draw my own conclusions, but the plots and numbers displayed herein are what they are — factual visualizations.\nOf course, if you’ve got some sweet data chops yourself, all calculations and visualizations can be seen on my GitHub page. Take a look, let’s chat about it.\nBasic assumptions Because we don’t know all of the exchanges’ wallet addresses (at least I don’t, yet), we have to make a few assumptions of who they are based the number of transactions an address has and its total amount invested.\nI have found tagged exchange addresses on EtherScan.io, cross referenced them against the DAO transactions, and they give the following information:\nExchange Ether invested Number of transactions -\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\nKraken 35522.70303 275\nGatecoin 194191.10361 843\nPoloniex 697929.88320 5826\nOk, so it’s clear that Poloniex has the majority of DAO purchases, and they’re all associated with one address (that I know of). But other exchanges that I found in the data run quite a range. Considering these numbers, I tagged any address that had over 30k Ether invested and over 100 transactions as an “exchange.” This led to the following table of “exchanges” :\nFive addresses end up contributing around 10% of the total Ether invested into The DAO. That’s a lot! Let’s take a moment to ponder the implications.\nWhat does this mean? When purchasing DAO tokens on an exchange, one has to enter extra specific information into a “data field,” so that the exchange knows where to send the tokens.\nThe required data field means that the exchange doesn’t hold the tokens; it only sends the Ether from a user’s account (assuming the user didn’t screw it up), and the respective tokens that are generated go to the provided off-exchange address provided in the data field.\nEssentially, all tokens associated with exchange purchases are distributed amongst addresses that I can’t see. Although we can’t know for sure yet, it is reasonable to assume that this group of addresses possesses the same wealth distribution as the addresses we can see.\nNamely, exchanges acting as platforms to purchase DAO tokens are not an issue, as they never control the tokens! During the creation phase, they’re only providing access points into the DAO, and are not acting as custodians of DAO tokens. Let’s take another look at wealth distribution, taking into account this new group, and see how it changes. Below is the same plot as the Part 1 blog post, but updated with the additional exchange group, and now we’re counting DAO tokens and not Ether because of the purchase rate changes.\nJeez, putting the exchanges in a separate category cut the last group of people in half. That means that 6 addresses, whoever they are, control ~10% of the voting power, instead of ~20%. While this does put more voting power into more people’s hands, the vast majority is skewed towards a relatively low percentage of addresses that own tokens: the very, very wealthy.\nWhat could happen next? If anything, this could lead to further token decentralization. There are many who have invested in The DAO because they plan on flipping the coins at a better rate than which they bought them. As more and more media attention flocks to this new and interesting concept, people will want in, and the tokens will be worth more simply due to demand.\nThis means people will buy tokens from others who have them, and at a premium, because no more tokens will be created. Good, somebody made a smart short-term investment decision and made some skrilla’. If you bought during the first phase of 100 DAO tokens for every Ether, then you can (more than likely) make a 50% return on your investment, considering people are still purchasing tokens at 100 DAO tokens for ever 1.5 Ether.\nMore importantly, every time someone who buys tokens from someone else, overall decentralization is increased, as the distribution of voting power of spread across more people. As more and more understanding and knowledge is spread about the DAO, investors with more informed opinions will buy tokens as well.\nFurthermore, since its inception, many have jumped into throwing Ether at the DAO for FOMO (“fear of missing out,” for those of you who don’t know) purposes. Based on the severe lack of understanding of what The DAO is, how it operates, and what it wants to do, it isn’t a far cry to assume that many who’ve invested hope to make a quick buck, and a non-trivial percentage of those people are just going to split when they get their tokens to get their Ether back for a zero-sum gain.\nWho these people are, and how it will effect the above chart, I don’t know. Also, I haven’t thought deeply enough to postulate an educated guess. Throw some comments at me — I’ll field them if they are sufficiently non-trollish.\nWhen did people invest, and how much? We’ve finished the rate changing days of the creation phase, so let’s check out the number of transactions/tokens distributed per day since this bad boy got started:\nFrom the plot, high initial bars indicate that people were waiting to invest as soon as possible. This is followed by a steady flow of both transactions and received tokens, slowly growing until the tokens/ether rate started rising. We see a sharp increase and peak around the time of the rate change, and drastic decline in investments, due to the rate increase, and diminishing returns from Ether invested.\nPut on your conclusions hat This increase and peak is a product of many investors attempting to gather as much information as possible before throwing a large amount of money into something so very new, at the best rate they can. If this is true, we can at least know we have a high number of smart investors who care about their investments, gathered as much information as they could, and still decided to invest, which is ultimately good for the organization.\nThis also accounts for a large amount of the total Ether invested regardless of what group they lie in, meaning that the majority of tokens holders (more than likely) gather as much information as they can before making an investment decision.\nHopefully, this behavior translates to proposals. How we spend this money, and the subsequent change it generates, will ultimately tell whether or not The DAO is a success.\n","description":"WTF, Mate?!","id":23,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Looking at the DAO Token Distribution: Part 2","uri":"http://coreypetty.com/posts/medium/corpetty/looking-at-the-dao-token-distribution-part-2-c77e7c4ac81c/"},{"content":"Great general overview of the current state of Ethereum.

Gone are the days you can get the 100 DAO Tokens for 1 ETH. Due to the relatively high difficulty in understanding what The DAO actually is, and how to actually invest in it, I think that the majority of the potential investors have already “gone in.” I could be wrong, but either way, I think an analysis of the token distribution up to this point is in order.\nWhy? Because it matters for how voting will go down. Each individual address that has invested into the DAO will have a single vote per proposal “yes” or “no”, but it is weighted by the amount of tokens that address has control of, as outlined in the Whitepaper.\nFor simplicity’s sake, and to stay consistent for now, we will only look at the 1ETH/100Token rate blocks, so up to block # 1520860 (thanks @deskenny from the Slock.it slack). I will do an update including the remaining investments and its analysis later.\nAll data was retrieved from EtherScan.io APIs, using the Python scripting language in the Jupyter Notebook environment. All visualizations are made using the Plot.ly APIs. A link to the interactive version can be found below all plots. Also, you can download the source here on my GitHub account. If you find a problem, let me know — I’ll fix it (or make a pull request).\nLet’s dip our toes into the basics Ok, so the first period is over, and in this timeframe, we’ve sourced quite a bit of chedda’:\nETH 10,264,539.20657231\nBTC 256,613.48016431\nUSD 117,079,900.32496539\nWhat is important to note is that this amount will only be constant in its ETH evaluation, which means if the price goes up with either ETH/BTC or BTC/USD, so will the (layman) evaluation of The DAO.\nThis was sourced from a total of 42,024 transactions from 14,611 unique addresses. What are the initial statistics one would first look at? (All amounts in ETH.)\nmean 244.254217\nstd 2250.690264\nmin 0.000000\n25% 1.000000\n50% 10.000000\n75% 85.000000\nmax 201911.999580\nhm… that’s quite a range, the 75th percentile is 85 ETH, but the max is over 200k ETH?! I think we need to dive a bit deeper to see who is putting money into this thing, and how much. But first, let’s just take a look at how this thing has grown since its inception. Here is a chart of the amount of Ether invested as a function of block number:\nWhat kind of people are in The DAO? There is quite a cross-section of people who have entered into the world’s very first DAO: speculators, visionaries, developers, wealthy, not-so-wealthy-but-hopeful. I’d reckon those who’ve invested into The DAO would make up a microcosm of the entire crypto-community itself. What does that mean? It means that there is probably a representation of everyone in the crypto-community voting on what WE do with the money WE’VE put into it.\nAlthough we can’t really know exactly who put what in, through the beauty of the blockchain, we can at least get a good idea of the distribution of wealth. Let’s start with just a simple breakdown of the distribution of investors, based on the amount invested in Ether:\n0 \u0026lt; % accounts \u0026lt; 1 : 23.8131593559134\n1 \u0026lt; % accounts \u0026lt; 10 : 12.8747917823431\n10 \u0026lt; % accounts \u0026lt; 100 : 26.3811771238201\n100 \u0026lt; % accounts \u0026lt; 1000 : 27.5610771793448\n1000 \u0026lt; % accounts \u0026lt; 10000 : 8.17601332593004\n10000 \u0026lt; % accounts \u0026lt; 100000 : 1.13131593559134\n100000 \u0026lt; % accounts : 0.06246529705719\nInteresting. A good portion of total investors have less than 1 Ether associated to their address. About half of all accounts are split (almost evenly) between addresses having between 10 and 100 Ether, and between 100 and 1,000 Ether associated with them. In a sense, the vast majority of us contributed what we could to the cause. We want to be a part of something larger than us, and potentially make some money.\nThe Reality Here is what is important. It is naive to think that the voting power comes from these large groups of accounts. Looking at the distribution of accounts above, one would initially think that this is good. The majority of people in the DAO are normal folks, who’ve invested a normal amount of money with a few people who’ve invested a lot, and an even smaller few more who’ve invested more than I’ll ever make (probably). Power with the people! Right?\nNope…\nLet’s take a look at what these numbers look like when each address distribution is paired with how much of the total voting pool they have “control over.” That is to say, their portion of tokens have this much weight on votes, when compared with everyone else.\nThink of this chart in this way: Each blue bar has control of the orange bar next to it when voting. This looks a bit more realistic, if we are to assume that the people who have invested into the DAO is a microcosm of real life. The wealthy few (top 1% of addresses) control over 55% of the voting power of proposals, while everyone who contributed 100 Ether or less (more than 66%) control barely over 2% of the total tokens.\nAnother illuminating example. Let’s say we have a proposal, and almost every single token holder is in the same boat, they vote “yes.” Now, Douchey McDouchFace comes in, and he holds a TON of tokens, and he doesn’t like the proposal. His single “no” could potentially nullify the thousands of “yes” votes. Furthermore, if McDouchFace wants to +1 his douche-level, he can wait until the very last minute to vote, so that people assume a “yes.” This is quite an exaggerated example, but a very possible one, nonetheless.\nTo say the least, clear communication is going to be necessary.\nThe Silver Lining This is to be expected, and isn’t automatically a problem. If it was irrespective of number of tokens, and 1 address = 1 vote, then it would be trivially easy to Sybil attack the DAO. Also, if you contribute a relatively small amount, you shouldn’t have a “huge swinging say” with what the entire organization does. You need to put your money where your mouth is. This is not unlike a lot of traditional organizations. Where the key difference lies is that you have a vote at all, and it is counted transparently and securely. Also, if you don’t like what those in voting power are doing, then leave, with your money, and continue to receive dividends from the proposals you were previously a part of, AFTER YOU’VE LEFT.\nI, personally, am betting that those with large investments in The DAO will do whatever benefits them, which should also benefit The DAO. They can’t attack the organization, and then take their money out, due to the smart contract and the way it works. The DAO is a FOR PROFIT organization, so big players should work to make the entire organization flourish.\nI’ve considered other interesting trends in the data and played with the transaction data quite a bit more. But for now, this is probably the best place to start, and other information may distract from the conversation. As a finisher, here are the addresses of who invested over 100000 Ether:\nWelcome to the future, let’s bring everyone with us.\nUPDATE: It was brought to my attention that these large addresses are mostly, if not all, exchanges that are holding tokens for customers (credit to @colm of the slock.it slack). This has been confirmed by looking the number of transactions each of these addresses has with The DAO address.\nThis ultimately means that the distribution is more in favor of the many, and a bit less in favor of the few. How the tokens are dispersed, and subsequent decentralization is the topic of a near-future blog post.\n","description":"What?!","id":25,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Looking at the DAO address distribution: Part 1","uri":"http://coreypetty.com/posts/medium/corpetty/looking-at-the-dao-address-distribution-part-1-f324e71381bf/"},{"content":"We got an interesting question on one of our latest episodes on the topic of mining and how the market cap could effect it.\n Enjoyed the show guys,\n  Thinking about mining and the price of bitcoin and decentralization… Do you guys think that an increase in the price of bitcoin, i.e. 1trillion market cap, or more, would have a negative effect on mining? To the point that it would not be worth it for big miners to mine because the resources put into operation do not correlate to greater returns. It tapers off. Kind of like banks with a lot of cash but no ways to put that cash into play.\n  Thanks\nGustavo\n Interesting question. As I started to answer his question in the “reply” box on-site, the response quickly became too large. So I’m making it a blog post.\nTL;DR: In my opinion, such a drastic increase in market cap would only exacerbate current issues.\nLet’s say currently, we have:\n1.) a single BTC = $431 USD\n2.) block reward = $10,800 USD\nA market cap increase to 1 trillion, holding everything else the same, would equate to:\n1.) a single BTC = $65,000 USD\n2.) block reward = ~$1.6 million USD\nThere are, on average, 144 blocks found per day, which means we have around 230 million USD coming into the market every day, at a trillion USD market cap.\nSuch an income would only make people with large amounts of money buy machine farms that would be relatively inexpensive compared to the potential earnings, and create large businesses to farm BTC.\nNow, this is where the problem gets tricky. I routinely work with large computing clusters for my research, and maintaining them is no easy feat. Other factors come into play at farms this size, and that is infrastructure, e.g. electricity costs, supplying enough energy, cooling, physical space, network bandwidth, maintenance, administration, updating hardware (HUGE), etc. Optimizing these issues becomes what businesses really end up doing, and whoever can minimize the cost of this multivariate problem(not a trivial mathematical problem) is essentially who is most profitable.\nThe point though, is that because the profitability of a single coin becomes drastically more, the amount of people mining would drastically grow, which means the adaptive difficulty of mining would grow in turn, effectively pushing out the small mining operations to an extent far greater than the current situation. We might see more large-scale operations, or only the current ones grow in size. The former would mean greater relative decentralization, but much more centralization than the vast majority of us picture as ideal.\nNow… this is only rough estimates. I’m holding a lot of variables constant, and assuming a lot of things about the free-market value of Bitcoin. But even under this current model, I think as the price of a single bitcoin rises, the centralization of mining gets worse.\nHope I answered his question in some way, shape, or form. I tend to go off on my own tangents when answering other people’s questions. If not, I enjoyed thinking about things, and hope you guys enjoyed reading about it.\nHere’s a pdf of my “calculations” I did in Mathematica to think this up. They aren’t difficult, but are provided for transparency sake. Hit me up if you think I’m wrong about something, I’m sure some of you do.\n","description":"We got an interesting question on one of our latest episodes on the topic of mining and how the market cap could effect it.","id":26,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Bitcoin Market Cap and Mining Decentralization","uri":"http://coreypetty.com/posts/medium/corpetty/we-got-an-interesting-question-on-one-of-our-latest-episodes-on-the-topic-of-mining-and-how-the-dc475ab79bea/"},{"content":"Note: This is a copy-over from our website’s blog, which we are transfering over to this platform. It was originally published 7 months ago, and hosted on http://thebitcoinpodcast.com/bitcoin-as-a-vehicle-for-personal-growth/\nThere seems to be a problem here\nOften times when talking with people about Bitcoin, I get a lot of questions about safety and security. This usually leads to a discussion culminating with the questioner’s realization of their own ignorance of how money actually works. This bothers me. Why does society know so little about something that literally affects almost every aspect of their life? Whatever your dream is, whatever you’re trying to accomplish in life, it probably involves money. The current infrastructure of money could be the most deeply-rooted part of our society and, simultaneously, the most misunderstood. People are quick to criticize and question the validity of a new currency or transaction system — while blindly trusting the system they currently use — even though they know almost nothing about it. Sometimes, people can even be hostile towards anything that challenges this system.\nThis reoccurring situation of blissful ignorance has lead to a lot of thought on my part, and as I’ve dug deeper and deeper, it seems to stem from a common desire to offload personal responsibility. We aren’t attempting to solve problems, or even understand problems; we simply leave it to someone else to think about. We assume that someone else is better equipped to handle the issue and, subsequently, don’t think about it at all. The only time it becomes front page news is when it turns bad and is likely to cause a negative effect on one’s life. We aren’t worried about out debt until we can’t afford to make minimum payments, so we rack it up until then. When it comes to that point, it is often asked, “why didn’t anyone tell me that this would happen?” Maybe even a “how has a system like this been put into place that takes advantage of people like me?” This has led me to question our core fundamental behaviors and what motivates them. Does the current infrastructure of money, how we fundamentally transact value on a daily basis, reinforce the behavior of offloading personal responsibility, or is this just a symptom of natural human behavior?\nWe don’t need to worry about that, someone else is doing it for us\nI think, deep down, I am attracted to Bitcoin because it puts the onus for financial responsibility squarely in the hands of the individual. This idea, taking personal responsibility for oneself, is something I find to be extremely valuable in personal development. With Bitcoin, if you lose your password, you’ve lost your bitcoin. If you don’t secure your bitcoin, and someone hacks you and steals them, you’ve lost your bitcoin. There isn’t someone you can complain to to get it back. It is your fault, and you have to deal with that. This seems scary and a potential downside to most people. Why? Because most have never had to worry about taking responsibility for their own personal wealth, they’ve offloaded it to others and trust that is secure. It has always been someone else’s job to fix whatever mistake they’ve made with their money. I think that by changing the very basis of how we transact value (i.e. Bitcoin), we can bring back a bit of that natural education towards securing yourself from threats outside.\nYou might be thinking “does this really matter?” Here are just a few examples of how this line of thinking can deter you as an individual:\n1.) “If it isn’t my fault, then someone else can handle it.”\n This only hinders our ability to understand the world, as well as the people around us. Every time this crosses our minds, we feed a natural tendency to not take part, to isolate ourselves.  2.) If someone else will always fix it, then I need not worry about it, or even think about it.\n This is the entrance to corruption, people don’t take advantage of others if they know they will be caught. If they do, then they’ve done it long enough to feel a significant power advantage, so as to not be punished. If you have a problem with something you purchased or service you’ve requested, you tell your credit card company or bank, and they issue you a chargeback. Cool. The problem with this is days later the money is taken from the provider, without a way to rectify the problem. By letting someone else take care of it, you deprive the provider to better his service, or understand the problem. With Bitcoin, there are no chargebacks. It is just as if you handed someone cash for a service. If there is a problem, a dialogue must begin in order for it to be solved, with allows things to improve.  This is subtly and profoundly changing us\nNow, I’m not writing this to point out my personal problems with how we interact socially. I’m trying to say that maybe the infrastructure of money influences how we interact with people a little more than it did previously. I mean, think about it. We move our money in a very dehumanizing way. You don’t even have to talk to anyone to purchase things. You just swipe a plastic card and it’s yours. That number in your online banking is then a little bit less, until it gets bigger when your job auto deposits some more numbers in. No human contact. To further this, I have always felt as though modern societal norms attempt to drive focus towards trivialities, and subtly teaches the masses to “leave all important decisions to someone more qualified than you.” For instance, many know about current affairs with celebrities who contribute nothing of real value to society but are unable to name their state congressmen.\nHere’s the problem with this trend. A society raised in this culture doesn’t cultivate responsibility, which stifles many aspects of personal improvement. If no important decisions are ever left up to the individual, then how do they learn how to deal with important decisions? They don’t, or their solutions are trivial (not even worth the words they use to communicate the solution). If our children think this way from the beginning, we are shaping little humans to not care about their fellow man. Here’s an example that’s a little more concrete. If a child breaks a beloved toy through improper care or negligence of some kind, and the solution is to replace the toy, then a child can never learn to take care of his belongings. By depriving the negative emotions of loss, you never learn the ability to accept the consequences of personal actions. I think the core idea of this childish example is reinforced in many aspects of our lives, starting from childhood and continuing through adulthood.\nWhy don’t we care about this?\nNow, humor me that it is possible that our money system influences the way we interact with each other negatively. How has this happened, and why does it continue? I think it could be due to our outdated view of money. It seems to me that most people carry around the same monetary ideals of a person that lived in medieval times would have, probably because that is the societal education we receive about money. For example, when we hear the story of Robin Hood, we automatically paint a picture in our heads that includes little cloth pouches of gold coins attached at the hip containing a person’s money for the day. If they wanted to buy something, they fished out the right amount, the vendor bit the coin to test metallic malleability (thus validity), and a transaction was made: bread was purchased, people were bribed, snake oil was sold, etc. We’d assume that people didn’t carry around all of their personal wealth in that pouch because that would simply be irresponsible– they weren’t dummies! If you were robbed in those days you lost everything, and you couldn’t do anything about it. Filing an identity theft claim with your bank or credit card holder was obviously not an option. But people understood this, and they kept their personal wealth safe somewhere. If they had a good amount of money, we’d assume they kept a large portion in the local bank, stored in a safe and guarded by people with weapons. It was harder to access because you had to go to a physical location to make withdrawals, but inconvenience is the price you pay for security, right? I would venture a guess that the VAST MAJORITY of people hold these same assumptions when thinking about our current time and place. Perhaps we tell ourselves that the current system is simply the same thing, but has had layers and layers of convenient tools added on top that allow us to check and access our money in the bank. That, my friends, is where things go awry.\nIt isn’t what you thought it was\nFast forward to modern times where there are major differences. Our society is not aware of the consequences of the current system because they think money behaves in much the same way as the medieval example. Our views are outdated. In these imaginary “olden days,” there were tangible goods that represented personal wealth, which could be taken or used whenever desired. Today, if everyone wants to actually take their money out of the bank, everything would fall apart. Banks aren’t holding all of the physical money; they’re holding an IOU, which is not actually tied to anything physical anymore. It is simply a digital number recorded and maintained by someone else. I’ll write more on this later (this thing is long already!), but just google fractional-reserve banking, and then start crying. If you want to watch something, this is a great documentary. But trust me, things probably aren’t working they way you think they are.\nWhy Bitcoin then?\nBecause the Bitcoin network, with its digital cash-esque vibe, puts the responsibility directly in your hands and thereby cultivates a more self-aware financial picture/landscape for the individual. It, ironically, puts the financial system closer to we as people think about money. Our pouches of money are our cell phones, our vault at home is a paper wallet we have stored offline, our banks are ourselves or some trusted online wallet with advanced security practices. Now, with Bitcoin, the technology is concurrent with the times. In a world where cryptocurrencies are the norm, personal asset security is commonplace. It HAS to be. The idea of knowing where your money is and how it is secured is a thought process that MUST occur. The responsibility is back in our own hands, and not left up to others who will misuse it. A child raised with these ideals hammered into him from his surroundings grows up taking responsibility for his own wealth. Maybe because of this, his ideals towards personal responsibility in general are improved.\nOutside of the sociological impact, we are in desperate need to upgrade the way we transact value to get in line with today’s technology, which is constantly pushed towards the idea of convenience. Every aspect of life has become faster, easier. We have 1-click purchasing with quick deliveries. Your refrigerator can remind you that you are running out of yogurt, and then place an order for you to have it delivered in a few days! This is all well and good, and I love convenience, but the transactional foundation this is built upon is essentially a piecemeal tricked-out Pony Express. The very core of exchanging value is archaic. We moved away from delivering letters to sending emails. How about we do the same for money?\nBecause of this all-encompassing technology in our lives, the security of everything we deem important about our wealth isn’t even considered by the vast majority. It is left to someone else. It is ASSUMED safe, when in reality it isn’t. Or at least not nearly as safe as we wrongly presume. The current infrastructure involved with the storage of personal wealth doesn’t reinforce personal security practices, which is leaving people wholly inadequately prepared to secure themselves in a the modern world. Why else is it that identity theft is so prevalent? It is because it is SO EASY to manipulate the ignorance of people’s security practices. Bitcoin helps solve this problem because it forces you to worry about your passwords and the security of your money. These are just a few reasons why I have chosen to adopt bitcoin now, and why I will continue to help the people around me learn more about the system, how it works, and why it is so much better than what is currently in use.\n","description":"Note: This is a copy-over from our website’s blog, which we are transfering over to this platform.
