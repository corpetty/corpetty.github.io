        <description>Introduction After an interview with Toby Simpson, the COO of fetch.ai, on Hashing It Out (will be released shortly), I shared a blog article of his that was mentioned in The Bitcoin Podcast slack for others to read it. It is a post about the consequences of &amp;ldquo;becoming a bank&amp;rdquo; that aren&amp;rsquo;t often talked about, and gives some guidance on how to increase your level of personal security by setting up a hardware wallet.</description>

        <description>As per usual, folks were sending interesting news in he Bitcoin Podcast slack. This one happened to catch my eye as it&#39;s an update I&#39;ve been waiting for; Bitcoin is getting two major improvements in historic code update from Decrypt. I immediately said we would talk about this in the upcoming The Bitcoin Podcast episode roundtable. But first, I&#39;d wanted to take some notes and jot down a few things so that I can share what these technologies are, what they potentially mean, and the remaining road ahead for those that don&#39;t listen the podcast, but are still interested.</description>

        <title>How to Understand What People Mean When They Say “We’re Probably in a Simulation.”</title>

        <description>I recently listened to an episode of Joe Rogan where Nick Bostrom tried to explain the concept of simulation theory. Although the progenitor of the concept tried multiple times, it seemed as though there was some roadblock to understanding, so I’d like to give it a shot. The best method would be to do it through the Socratic method, where questions are asked to allow the other participants to reach the conclusion desired themselves.</description>

        <description>If you’ve been around the cryptocurrency community for long, then you’ve definitely heard people preach sayings such as, “Always remember to control your private keys.” Maybe it was through a commonly said aphorism:
 Your keys, your crypto; Not your keys, not your crypto.
 But what does it actually mean? If you don’t understand public-private key cryptography, then those sayings offer no explanation or insight to one of the most important features of this technology: controlling the access to your value.</description>

        <description>I hear people throw shade at idea of Proof of Stake (PoS) protocols quite often. I think that most of these comments are founded in false assumptions, which inevitably lead them to false conclusions. That’s a deep amount of work, which requires some groundwork first. This is some groundwork, so this is about abstracting away some of the roles Proof of Work (PoW) plays in blockchain protocols, and looking at how randomness is at the heart of them, and where that randomness comes from.</description>

        <description>So I get hit up quite frequently about various coins and whether or not they’re worth looking into, are a scam, are legit, etc. So I’ve decided to try and pick some of the coins I get asked about most that I don’t already know about, and read a bit about them, and give some off-the-cuff opinions on their validity to refer my friends and family to. I hope others find these useful.</description>

        <description>When reading about Bitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain, other alt coins, etc… (I’ll use capital B — Blockchain here to encompass them all) I hear a lot of people say something akin to the following:
 Blockchain can’t be good at everything, it has to choose one thing and be the best at it, and that should be &amp;lt;insert your idea here&amp;gt;.
 Hell, I’m guilty of saying things like this myself, which is partly why I’m writing this.</description>

        <description>Unlike most of my posts or writings, this is not a technical one. It borrows from the technical world a bit, but its purpose is more of a social endeavor.
I’ve always had this amorphous construction in my head that I’ve used to think about what makes a person who they are. Why do they make the decisions they make and what makes them tick? I’m sure you’ve heard the term “everyone is a unique snowflake” or some form of that mentality.</description>

        <description>NOTE UP FRONT: I express my opinions here (at least at the end of the article). If you don’t like them and don’t have evidence to support your dislike, then go kick rocks.
Things are moving forward quite rapidly in this space; I simply don’t have time to look at all the ICOs (ya know, full time job, podcast, wife, and stuff), but this one struck me as different while also being wildly anticipated.</description>

        <description>Jesus H. Christ folks. I’ve put off doing this one a little bit, in part because I’m a bit depressed/disappointed/confused/? in the direction this is headed. As always, I’ll leave my opinions until the end, so those of you who are strictly reading for the data herein can click “close” when I start ranting.
The Basic Attention Token ICO, lead by Brendan Eich, is an attempt to tokenize human attention on the internet.</description>

        <description>Another ERC20 Initial Coin Offering (ICO), another ridiculous amount of money, in another ridiculously short period of time. This time around, it’s with the Aragon Project, a play at making “unstoppable organizations on the blockchain.”
Not gonna lie, I played with their Alpha release, and enjoyed it. It has potential to do some cool stuff. The goal of this article is not to critique the platform, but only to look at the distribution of Ethereum ICOs to help people see the trends of the space.</description>

        <description>This is another look at the distribution of an ICO in the Ethereum space, because I think its important to see the overall trends of how these projects are getting funded so we can draw rational conclusions from evidence, instead of just saying stuff that we feel without any real backing.
What’s TokenCard? Monolith Studio’s TokenCard is a platform to hold your ERC20 tokens, as well as spend them using a visa debit card.</description>

        <description>Edit: I changed Gnosis’ front page $300 extrapolated number to 250k ETH at $50/ETH = $12.5 Mil for clarity and self containment.
Alright, so the Gnosis dutch auction reached their goal of 250K ETH in less than 15 minutes. I’m not too terribly surprised, to be honest, it was an incredibly popular project in the space.
$12.5 million in less than 15 minutes…
I was too late, because I was fiddling around with other things, like my job.</description>

        <description>Here I will attempt to perform a line-by-line description of Gavin’s recent preliminary hard-fork code submitted to github, which can be found here. I am not a Rust coder, but I have experience with low-level programming languages (Fortran, C), and high-level scripting languages (Python, R, Bash), so I feel I have a pretty good idea what’s going on.
It is important that everyone understand what the code is doing, regardless of whether or not they can read code.</description>

        <description>It’s clear something tremendous has happened to the cryptocurrency environment, and it’s not the good kind of something. You’re about to be inundated with a large amount of coverage about all things crypto from many sources, and a lot of it will probably be garbage.
 An opinion is only worth the facts that are used to form it.
 In other words, if nothing concrete is backing the things coming out of your mouth, then you’re spewing bullshit, and your opinion doesn’t matter.</description>

        <description>Well boys and girls, we’ve done some things. If you’ve invested into The DAO, welcome to the largest crowdfunded/kickstarter/other “traditional analogy that doesn’t quite cut it” in history. The truth is, we’ve done something historical, and possibly game changing and foundational to how organizations pool and spend money (among other things). Let’s take some more time to look at who has invested, and how much has been put in, to see if we can draw some conclusions</description>

        <description>So the first purchase ratio of The DAO creation phase is over. Gone are the days you can get the 100 DAO Tokens for 1 ETH. Due to the relatively high difficulty in understanding what The DAO actually is, and how to actually invest in it, I think that the majority of the potential investors have already “gone in.” I could be wrong, but either way, I think an analysis of the token distribution up to this point is in order.</description>

        <description>We got an interesting question on one of our latest episodes on the topic of mining and how the market cap could effect it.
 Enjoyed the show guys,
  Thinking about mining and the price of bitcoin and decentralization… Do you guys think that an increase in the price of bitcoin, i.e. 1trillion market cap, or more, would have a negative effect on mining? To the point that it would not be worth it for big miners to mine because the resources put into operation do not correlate to greater returns.</description>

        <description>In David Johnston’s white paper outlining what a decentralized application is by definition, he lists 4 mandatory criteria of a DApp:
 1. The application must be completely open-source, it must operate autonomously, and with no entity controlling the majority of its tokens. The application may adapt its protocol in response to proposed improvements and market feedback but all changes must be decided by consensus of its users.

        <description>Note: This is a copy-over from our website’s blog, which we are transferring over to this platform. It was originally published 7 months ago, and hosted on http://thebitcoinpodcast.com/bitcoin-as-a-vehicle-for-personal-growth/
There seems to be a problem here
Often times when talking with people about Bitcoin, I get a lot of questions about safety and security. This usually leads to a discussion culminating with the questioner’s realization of their own ignorance of how money actually works.</description>

        <description>What’s up folks? Welcome to another round of ICO analysis, this time we look at Bancor. They’re making a play at becoming the new standard for tokens. As per usual, I’m not commenting on platform legitimacy here, only the ICO model they use, its results, and their relation to trends in the entire ecosystem (the last part being my own personal views).
Starting out, I’d like to point out some previous posts about this subject that should be looked at.</description>

        <description>“Blockchain” is all the rage, but why?  Many people will have varying answers to that question, and a lot of those answers carry validity. The technology that underpins Bitcoin is gaining hype because its proposing to help solve problems in many different fields that dramatically affect our lives. The purpose of this post is not to give a broad overview of all the reasons blockchain is innovative, you can google that if you have not heard of them.</description>

        <description>So there has been a decent amount of controversy with the MyEtherWallet (MEW) “fork” to MyCrypto. We at The Bitcoin Podcast have chosen to follow MyCrypto, and fully support their team for a multitude of reasons, and I felt it reasonable to explain the decision behind that support. Tl;dr: We follow people, not project names. When I first got into crypto, I found it fun and interesting to follow what was going on.</description>

        <description>A micro-community isn’t new. You belong to many of them already, they’re just inefficient. The internet unlocked our ability to join them, but it’s limitations held them at the distance of a hobby. Blockchain technology is the key to unlock their real potential, allowing us to earn a living by contributing to the causes we care about. What is a micro-community?
This topic has come up a few times in the past months on The Bitcoin Podcast and Hashing It Out, and it’s a topic I’ve been tossing around my head for the past few years.</description>
