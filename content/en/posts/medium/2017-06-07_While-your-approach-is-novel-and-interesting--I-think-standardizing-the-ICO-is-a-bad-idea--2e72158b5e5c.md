While your approach is novel and interesting, I think standardizing the ICO is a bad idea. People do ICO’s for different reasons, and the way they distribution their tokens should reflect their overall goal and its specific use.

I do enjoy the gaming (or lack thereof) of your ruleset. Convincing projects to get past the greed will be difficult though. At the end of the day, the token WILL BE decentralized, but at a fee and high profit of the initial investors if there is enough demand.

For example, the number of BAT address holders currently is at 2632 addresses, an increase from 2222 addresses at the time of my article writing. The exchanges area doing the actual decentralizing of the tokens, and the initial investors are making a KILLING.

Once again, we’ve ironically introduced middlemen into a technology that got its name from disintermediation. Humans are funny.
