Yes that is very much true. Due to the form of the ICO, the optimal strategy would be to sybil the ICO and create as many lower investment transactions as possible, and spam the system in hopes of getting them through. I’ve stated in previous articles that the analysis doesn’t show actual uniqueness of individuals per address, but it at least rolls up multiple transactions from the same address.

I started one on Bancor, but never actually got it published. I also left out the majority of the transaction analysis (backlog, timing, relative impact) due to time and conciseness, and also in hopes that others might throw their hat in.
