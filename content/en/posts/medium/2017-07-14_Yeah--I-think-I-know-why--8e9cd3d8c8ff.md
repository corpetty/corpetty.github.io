Yeah. I think I know why. I copied over the analysis of a previous ICO, and one of the variables (total amount raised) was hard coded. I fixed this in later ones, but this one I must have run past it.

Thank you for pointing that out! I will fix it and give you the proper credit.

That being said, the relative differences between the bins should still be accurate.
