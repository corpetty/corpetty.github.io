This is a very true point, and something I point out in previous articles, but not this one. The ICO model would tend to incentivize that behavior. I also mentioned it in a previous response. I’ll add a note to the article addressing this.

There are a few things we can do to look at this:

*   If someone is attempting to hoard, then we _might_ see consolidation of addresses into a single holding address over time. This assumes that is a strategy someone would want to employ (less attack surface of coin holdings vs. distribution across multiple addresses).
*   I didn’t show it, but there was a significant roll-up of addresses that contributed multiple times, showing that addresses that wanted higher amounts of SNT basically spammed the network, and subsequently dealing with nonce issues.

*   There is also plenty of evidence that a good size portion of the investors did not take the tactic of breaking up their desired investment across multiple accounts, as the size of refunded ETH exceeds the actual raised ETH, across a decently large number of accounts. While this is not a perfect metric for measuring people not breaking up investments, it alludes to the behavior.
