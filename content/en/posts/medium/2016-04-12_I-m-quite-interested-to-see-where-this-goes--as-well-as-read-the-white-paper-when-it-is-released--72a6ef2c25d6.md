I’m quite interested to see where this goes, as well as read the white paper when it is released.

I’m assuming the upcoming Google Hangout mentioned in [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4e9mlx/anonymous_decentralized_debt/) will also delve into some details, as tackling the student loan debt crisis is a daunting task, and not to be taken lightly.

I’m hopeful, but skeptical.
