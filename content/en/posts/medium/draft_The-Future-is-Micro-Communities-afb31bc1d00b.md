A micro-community isn’t new. You belong to many of them already, they’re just inefficient. The internet unlocked our ability to join them, but it’s limitations held them at the distance of a hobby. Blockchain technology is the key to unlock their real potential, allowing us to earn a living by contributing to the causes we care about. 

**What is a micro-community?**

This topic has come up a few times in the past months on The Bitcoin Podcast and Hashing It Out, and it’s a topic I’ve been tossing around my head for the past few years. 

A micro-community is exactly what it sounds like, a “small” community, not necessarily in size of the group, but in diversity of topic. 

**What did the internet do, and what did it miss?**

The internet made a drastic change to our capability to form communities, as it lifted the geographical constraint. The free access to information and subsequent social networks allowed us to find people who cared about the things we cared about, and congregate around those topics regularly without leaving our specific geographical region. 

**What did “Blockchain” do to change this?**

If we look at what Bitcoin did, and what the subsequent networks have tried to expand on, _it’s simply trustless digital scarcity_. Now from that base, we can more easily create subjective value, particularly within the context of a small group of people.
