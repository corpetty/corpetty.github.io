So there has been a decent amount of controversy with the MyEtherWallet (MEW) “fork” to MyCrypto. We at The Bitcoin Podcast have chosen to follow MyCrypto, and fully support their team for a multitude of reasons, and I felt it reasonable to explain the decision behind that support. 

**Tl;dr: We follow people, not project names.** 

When I first got into crypto, I found it fun and interesting to follow what was going on. It was my hobby, I would come home from work and then get caught up on the state of crypto. That is no longer an option. Even though I spend just about every waking moment attempting to stay up-to-date and on top of things in this space, it is is nigh impossible to understand everything that is going on due to to the exponential increase in interest and project development throughout. 

Because of this, I’ve shifted my methodology to following people I trust to be key players that align with my ideals, and have proven to be useful in pushing the boundary of this technology. Since the beginning of Ethereum, MEW had proven to encompass the ideals of what the roles of wallet software should be: Never holding customer funds, allowing a simple and intuitive user interface, attempting to educate those being on-ramped to this new disruptive technology, being FREE, etc. Putting it simply, they got it. 

Then ICOs blew up.

 We lowered the entrance barrier of offering a Ethereum based crowdsale, and saw an explosion of new users. MEW stepped up to the plate and attempted to help these newcomers safely participate. This is a technology of inclusion, they provided the gateway of that inclusion. 

This was incredibly evident through the quickly updated UI that pre-filled gas prices based on smart contract addresses of ICOs, the ever-constant Reddit presence of answering queries and questions about how to use wallets, the presence at conferences to interact with people of the community. The sheer effort to interact with the people that used their product. If you interacted with Ethereum, you used MEW. If you had a problem, there was actually a support team to answer your question.

I followed MEW, brought them on our podcast, met up with them at conferences. They invited me to the anti-phishing groups that they created to combat the problems with scams, fake ICOs, false narratives. 

I quickly became friends with Taylor and her team. Her personality was raw, which we appreciate on TBP, because real is always better than fake. Whatever emotion she showed online was a real reaction to the weight felt by her and the team to try and protect and educate the community from those trying to steal their funds, or the ignorance of new users to this new technology. 

Then they forked to a new company called MyCrypto to position themselves appropriately to grow to fulfill the massive role this “side project” had become. From an outside perspective, we saw it as “the team had expanded, they need to restructure to properly deal with the this expansion. It is clear that MEW isn’t a side project, and is something that is central to the interface of Ethereum.”

Enter kvhnuke.

Apparently, the founder didn’t want this to happen.
