[I](https://github.com/DavidJohnstonCEO/DecentralizedApplications)n David Johnston’s [white paper](https://github.com/DavidJohnstonCEO/DecentralizedApplications) outlining what a decentralized application is by definition, he lists 4 mandatory criteria of a DApp:

> 1\. The application must be completely [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), it must operate autonomously, and with no entity controlling the majority of its tokens. The application may adapt its protocol in response to proposed improvements and market feedback but all changes must be decided by consensus of its users.

> 2\. The application’s data and records of operation must be cryptographically stored in a public, decentralized [blockchain](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain)in order to avoid any central points of failure.

> 3\. The application must use a cryptographic token (bitcoin or a token native to its system) which is necessary for access to the application and any contribution of value from (miners / farmers) should be rewarded in the application’s tokens.

> 4\. The application must generate tokens according to a standard crytptographic algorithm acting as a proof of the value nodes are contributing to the application (Bitcoin uses the Proof of Work Algorithm).

Based on my understanding, isn’t a DAO just a DApp for governance?

It is a decentralized way of dealing with how to properly take into account people’s vested interest in any given thing.

Is there really anything different on a fundamental level, or can I consider a DAO a DApp?
