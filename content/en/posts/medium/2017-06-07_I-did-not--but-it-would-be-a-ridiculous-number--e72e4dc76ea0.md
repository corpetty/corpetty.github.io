I did not, but it would be a ridiculous number. The amount of error transactions is quite large. They put a cap that way because they had a certain amount of BAT they wanted to distribute, and attached an ETH number to that, giving an exchange rate.

This allowed them to create a much simpler smart contract (not that they couldn’t have done other methods) that auto pays out to the sender’s address the correct amount of BAT.

Just doing a back of the envelop calculation (meaning there are subtleties to actually doing this that don’t quite work), here is the amount of ETH that was attempted to be invested during the ICO for the first 3,4,5 blocks, which includes the successful transactions:

three blocks:  209809.46188 ETH  
four blocks:   214192.696177 ETH  
five blocks:   234496.120979 ETH

and this continues for a while. If this was done this way, he would have been BY FAR the largest ICO with a ridiculous valuation, and a post-calculation of BAT distribution to the investors.
