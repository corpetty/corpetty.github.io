While I appreciate your decision to solve the problem rather than pivot to avoid it, I’m not sure I agree with you’re stance that companies who choose to adopt across platforms (option #1) will fail.

I feel like there is a niche of use cases that is emboldened by the choice to use the strengths of each platform, instead of add-hoc attempting to re-invent the wheel (not that I’m saying this is what you’re doing).

Take [Plutus](http://www.plutus.it), for example. It seems their company is (in my opinion) using both Ethereum and Bitcoin correctly. Choosing option 3 for them is to develop from the ground up, potentially pushing a much needed service to the Bitcoin space further down the road, or wait for something like RootStock to (hopefully) provide smart contracts to Bitcoin, also postponing release.
