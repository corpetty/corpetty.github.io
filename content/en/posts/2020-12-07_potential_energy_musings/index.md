**potential energy** - The capacity to do work. It is arbitrary, in that the only meaningful thing you can say about potential is to describe how it changes. 

> Potential energy ... has no absolute meaning; only _differences_ of potential energy are physically meaningful. {{<cite bib="ThortonMarion2004">}}

This is the same case of kinetic energy, we _only care about changes_ to it.
