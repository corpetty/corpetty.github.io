## Introduction

Someone in my life copy and pasted a bunch of questions with "answers" about getting vaccinated for COVID, which leads the reader to beleive it is unreasonable to get the COVID vaccine. Funny enough, the copy and pasted text also asked for empirical evidence to back up the reasoning behind the answers to each of the questions. 

Looking at a surface level at all the questions and answers, it seems reasonable to get the COVID vaccine. If you spend any time whatsoever digging into the mountains of data to the actual answers to these questions, then such a stance (not getting vaccinated) is shaky at best, and highly contextualized to specific individuals. 

I'm not an epedimiologist, but I am a card carrying scientist with the skillset of understanding data. So let's walk through this chainmail post and actually ask ourselves some of these questions. I hope that in the end, you leave with at least a more nuanced perspective on the COVID virus, the vaccinations that are trying to combat it, and how to assess your personal risk. 

But before we start, you'll notice that there is some appeal to the government answers to these topics and not the massive scientific and medical community that actually provides the studies/data/reasoning behind it. The "government" is not who you should be asking most of these questions to. 

## The post

> **please note,  I do believe it is a personal choice to get the covid vaccine.. but right here is why I have chosen not to**
> Am I missing something? Please point me in the direction of empirical evidence that will help me understand this nonsense.
> Ok, so remind me again what is the purpose of being vaccinated against COVID-19? "THINK" about these statements!!
> "If I get vaccinated”:


> 1.- Can I stop wearing the mask? Government: No
> 2.- Can they reopen restaurants, pubs, bars etc. and everyone work normally? Government: No
> 3.- Will I be resistant to COVID-19? Government Response - Maybe, but we don't know exactly, it probably won't stop you getting it
> 4.- At least I won't be contagious to others anymore? Government Response - No, it doesn’t stop transmission.
> 5.- If I am vaccinated, can I stop social distancing? Government: No
> 6.- If I am vaccinated, can I stop disinfecting my hands? Government: No
> 7.- If I vaccinate myself and my grandparents, can we hug each other? Government: No
> 8.- Will cinemas, theatres and stadiums operate as per normal thanks to vaccines? Government: No
> 9.- What is the benefit of the vaccine? Government Response - Hoping the virus won't kill you.
> 10.- Are you sure it won't kill me? Government: No
> 11.- If statistically the virus won't kill me anyway (99.7% survival rate) ... Why would I get vaccinated?" Government Response - To protect others.
> 12.- So if I get vaccinated, I can protect 100% of people I come in contact with? Government: No
> 13.- Can you guarantee that I won’t experience adverse effects from taking the vaccine or die from the vaccine itself? Government Response - No
> 14. - Since you’re encouraging every American to get vaccinated then, when people experience severe adverse reactions, long term effects (still unknown) or die from the vaccine will they or their families be compensated? Government response: NO - the government and vaccine manufactures have 100% zero liability in experimental stages.
> 15. -How long does the vaccine last? Government response- we aren’t sure.
> So, to summarize, the Covid 19 vaccine... Does not give immunity. Does not eliminate the virus. Does not prevent death. Does not guarantee you won’t get it. Does not stop you passing it on. Does not eliminate the need for travel bans. Does not eliminate the need for business closures. Does not eliminate the need for lock-downs. Does not eliminate the need for masking.
> Copied and pasted, feel free to do the same
> I guess we are supposed to just trust the government then.
Abso-fucking-lutely not.
