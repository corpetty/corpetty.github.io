abstract: "We perform highly accurate rovibrational spectra calculations on the HO2 and
Ne4 systems using ScalIT, an exact quantum dynamics software suite designed
to perform such calculations across a massive number of computer processors in
a straightforward manner. HO2 calculations are performed up to the dissociation
threshold, corresponding to a total angular momentum value, J ≤ 130. A series of
theory–based J–shifting (JS) schemes are also introduced and applied to a representative set of J values of HO2. The results are compared to both the previously mentioned
exact values calculated, and experimentally derived vibrational-state-dependent JS
results [J. Phys. Chem. A. 110, 3246, (2006)]. One of the introduced methods, the
modified effective potential (modEP) scheme, outperforms all others in all regimes,
and appears to be resistant to Coriolis-coupling effects. The modEP scheme is used
as an analysis tool to shed structural insight on the dynamics of Coriolis-coupled
eigenstate wave functions of HO2. The vibrational spectrum for Ne4 is calculated
for all possible permutation inversion symmetries, and the physically real states are
identified"
